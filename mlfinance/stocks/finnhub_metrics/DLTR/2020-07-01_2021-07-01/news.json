However, others argue that long-term unemployment is approaching a record. For those who believe the latter rather than the former, you might want some recession-proof stocks to buy just in case. In May 2018, I discussed three recession-resistant stocks that I thought would do well in the case of a downturn. They were Church & Dwight (NYSE:CHD), DollarTree (NASDAQ:DLTR), and Flowers Foods (NYSE:FLO). All three of these stocks did well during one or both of the 2001 and 2008 recessions. Since then, the three stocks appreciated by 68%, 4%, and 11%, respectively, over 33 months. By comparison, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) generated a 33% return over the same period. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Clearly, we didn\u2019t hit recession territory until well into the pandemic. And, if I\u2019d just gone with Dollar General (NYSE:DG) instead of DollarTree, my average return would have been 58%, not 28%. Live and learn, I guess. 9 Cheap Stocks That Look Like a Bargain Using the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLP) and the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLK), I\u2019ll come up with seven recession-proof stocks to buy: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Walmart (NYSE:WMT) PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Costco (NASDAQ:COST) Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy: Apple (AAPL) Source: View Apart / Shutterstock.com You\u2019re probably wondering about my first selection. While Apple might have almost $77 billion in cash, it\u2019s added a lot of debt since the 2008 recession. In 2008 and 2009, Apple didn\u2019t have any long-term debt, along with $24.5 billion and $34.0 billion, respectively, in cash. Today, Apple has $112 billion in total debt, or 32% of its total assets. Should consumers find themselves low on cash, big-ticket purchases like a new iPhone probably go right out the window? Well, that\u2019s the standard opinion. However, in the last three months of calendar 2008, Apple recorded record revenue of $10.2 billion, selling more than 2.5 million Macs and 4.3 million iPhones. While the iPhone was in the early stages of its overall growth, it was obvious even back then that the smartphone had become its future growth driver. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has wisely built a massive services business to add some balance to the company\u2019s top-and bottom-lines. In Q1 2021, Apple\u2019s gross margins from its services business increased 400 basis points to 68.4% while growing the top line by 24% over last year. With Apple\u2019s 5G iPhones coming, it probably seems silly to be talking about recession-resistant stocks. Still, when the economy softens, you\u2019ll want to own shares of quality companies because those stocks will have the best chance of maintaining their share prices in a market correction. Well-run companies never go out of style. Microsoft (MSFT) Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com It\u2019s been 11 years since Microsoft launched Azure, the software company\u2019s foray into cloud computing. The company\u2019s commercial cloud business generated $44 billion in revenue in fiscal 2020. In 2015, it was less than $6 billion. In fiscal 2009, Microsoft saw its annual revenue drop by $2 billion (-3.4%) to $58.4 billion, its first-ever year-over-year decline. As a result, its operating income fell by 9% to $20.4 billion. Imagine owning a business that had 35% operating margins in a bad year. That\u2019s my idea of a recession-resistant business. Fast forward to today. It has a 39% operating margin from $153 billion in trailing 12-month revenue. CEO Satya Nadella really has the company humming. In the second decade of its existence, it\u2019s hard to imagine Microsoft without Azure. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be saying the same thing about another yet-to-be-determined product in 2031. 9 Cheap Stocks That Look Like a Bargain Interestingly, Microsoft has net cash of $62.6 billion, a number that even puts Apple to shame. Adobe (ADBE) Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com One of my better predictions in 202o was that Adobe\u2019s stock would hit $400 in 2020. That was in early February. It hit the target five months later, getting as high as $537.88 in September before settling into a tight range between $460 and $500. So, where to next? While I won\u2019t make a prediction, I will say that should a recession hit, Adobe\u2019s products will remain in demand because life goes on. PDFs don\u2019t go out of style. Nor does the rest of its product line, including Photoshop, used by approximately 90% of creative professionals. In 2020, it had record revenue of $12.9 billion, 15% higher than in 2019. On the bottom line, it had an operating income of $1.2 billion, 30% higher than a year earlier. In 2020, it generated $5.7 billion in operating cash flow, enabling it to buy back $3 billion of its stock at an average price of $375 a share. That\u2019s a 23% return on its investment despite the $25 correction year to date. The advent of the cloud has made Adobe even more essential in 2021. This year, Adobe expects to grow sales by 18% to $15.2 billion, with non-GAAP earnings of $11.20 per share. At 41 times 2021 earnings, it\u2019s not cheap. Five years from now, you won\u2019t regret having bought ADBE stock. Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy: Procter & Gamble (PG) Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com Just as I included Church & Dwight in my 2018 article about recession-resistant stocks, Procter & Gamble is the quintessential consumer staples stock. Defensive in nature, it\u2019s managing to make hay while the sun shines. It is growing its business at a time where many companies are finding it difficult to prosper. That\u2019s because a lot of its products aren\u2019t things most people will go without \u2014 recession or not. Of the company\u2019s 22 billion-dollar brands, I use 10 of them daily or weekly. That\u2019s not going to change in a recession. The same can be said for most people who hold down a decent-paying job. How did P&G do during the 2008 financial crisis? Well, leading up to the recession, the company raised prices to fight inflationary pressures in Europe. By Spring 2009, inflation had stopped rising, so it lowered prices. However, it gained approximately $1.4 billion in additional sales from those increases. Post-recession, the company put into place a plan that would see it introduce cheaper products in markets where consumers couldn\u2019t pay premium prices while keeping prices of many of its billion-dollar brands higher than average. In 2009, it generated $9.9 billion in free cash flow (FCF) from $76.7 billion in sales. In 2020, it had adjusted FCF of $14.9 billion from $71.0 billion, an 810 basis point improvement in its FCF margin. 9 Cheap Stocks That Look Like a Bargain Whatever happens in the next recession, P&G will be ready. Walmart (WMT) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com When the last recession hit in 2008, Walmart didn\u2019t have the e-commerce infrastructure it has today. That\u2019s made a big difference in its ability to fight through the pandemic. Walmart reported its fourth-quarter results in mid-February. It missed the analyst estimate of $1.51 per share by 12 cents. Since delivering its results, WMT stock has lost 13% of its value through March 2. According to Statista, Walmart had e-commerce sales of $36.9 billion in 2020. That\u2019s approximately 6.6% of its overall revenue of $559.2 billion. In 2013, Walmart\u2019s e-commerce sales were approximately $10 billion or 2.1% of its $476.3 billion in annual sales. Walmart continues to grow its e-commerce sales at a brisk pace. In the fourth quarter, they were 69% higher than a year earlier. As the margins improve and e-commerce sales grow to represent 10% of its overall revenues, the online business will become a profit center for the company. When the last recession hit, Walmart didn\u2019t have much of an online business. Now it does. That will make a huge difference should economic times get really tough. In the meantime, enjoy the fruits of its $20 billion share repurchase plan. PepsiCo (PEP) Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.com During an economic recession, consumers tend to tighten the purse strings. No major purchases or major financial commitments. That said, it doesn\u2019t mean the family wallet is shut completely with snacks and beverages very low on the priority list of spending cuts. In the recession years of 2007 to 2009, PepsiCo stock had a high of $79.57 and a low of $45.81. At the low, its share price declined 42.4% from its high. However, its earnings held their own, averaging almost 6% annual growth in 2008 through 2010. For those who care about dividends, PepsiCo increased its annual dividend payout from $1.35 in 2007 to $1.86 in 2010, a compound annual growth rate of 11.3%. So, even though the company\u2019s stock didn\u2019t completely hold up during the recession, it managed to get back to its 2007-2009 high of $79.57 by March 2013. To keep the company growing, PepsiCo is launching a line of cocktail mixers this month to meet the increased demand for at-home cocktails. Neon Zebra will come with four mixes: Margarita, Strawberry Daiquiri, Mojito, and Whiskey Sour. 9 Cheap Stocks That Look Like a Bargain Amazingly, the sale of cocktail mixers in the 12 months ended Feb. 13 rose by 36% to $305 million. It will be interesting to see what happens once the world returns to normal. Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy: Costco (COST) Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com Costco\u2019s business model makes it one of the best retail stocks to own for the long haul. I did, however, recommend that investors buy a half position, waiting for it to correct over the next three to six months to buy the other half. That time has come. Trading down more than 6% recently, COST stock is down 10% from Oct. 5, 2020, the date of my article, and almost 13% YTD. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) vice-chairman Charlie Munger recently stated that Costco held a specific advantage over Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) when it comes to growing its business. \u201cCostco, I do think, has one thing that Amazon does not. People really trust Costco to be delivering enormous values,\u201d Munger said Feb. 24. \u201cThat is why Costco presents some danger to Amazon \u2014 because they\u2019ve got a better reputation for providing value than practically anybody including Amazon.\u201d Years ago, I can remember then CEO, Jim Sinegal, discussing Costco\u2019s relentless push to get the best prices possible from its suppliers. However, it wasn\u2019t to make more money. The move was intended to push prices lower for its customers, making the bulk of its profits from its satisfied members\u2019 annual membership fees. Nothing\u2019s changed except that its sales are much higher. In fiscal 2009, Costco had membership fees of $1.53 billion, or 2.2% of its annual revenue. In fiscal 2020, they were $3.54 billion, or 2.2% of revenue. That\u2019s a compound annual growth rate of 7.9%. As every year passes, Costco gets more recession-resistant, not less.

Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Dollar Tree has. Dollar Tree's Debt Based on Dollar Tree's balance sheet as of November 24, 2020, long-term debt is at $3.23 billion and current debt is at $300.00 million, amounting to $3.53 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $1.12 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $2.41 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering Dollar Tree's $20.65 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.17. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and average for another. Why Debt Is Important Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.

Kolanovic believes that a decline in volatility and favorable monetary policies will combine to make stocks the go-to investment for 2021, fueling further market gains. Officially, JPM is forecasting a 25% gain in the S&P 500 over the next 12 months.With investors gravitating toward stocks, volatility low, and cash cheap, Kolanovic is predicting that institutional investors will also step up. In his recent note, the strategist says that $550 billion in combined hedge fund activity is likely for the stock markets in the mid-term. Taken together with the other factors, Kolanovic writes that \u201cthese inflows would overpower equity supply to drive equity markets higher.\u201dGetting to the nitty-gritty details, Kolanovic points out three key segments that investors should watch in the markets: financial stocks, energy stocks, and value stocks. He sees the first two benefitting from falling unemployment as the economy ramps back up, while the third will gain at the expense of growth stocks. Growth stocks and government bonds will lose ground generally during what JPM sees as a bullish year for the stock market.In addition to Kolanovic's look at the macro situation, analysts from JPMorgan have also been diving into specific stocks. Of particular interest, we\u2019ve pulled the\u00a0TipRanks data\u00a0on two stocks that the firm predicts will show powerful double-digit growth in the next year. And just for contrast, we\u2019ve included one that JPMorgan says to avoid. Dollar Tree (DLTR)First up is Dollar Tree, a major name in the discount retail segment. Dollar Tree operates more than 15,000 big-box stores across the US and Canada, offering a wide range of products, with many priced at $1 or less. Store departments include food and snacks, dairy and frozen groceries, housewares, household cleaning supplies, toys \u2013 in short, all the items customers can find at higher-end department stores and retailers, but for a discount price.The pandemic period has had less of an impact on Dollar Tree than on other retailers, at least in part due to the company\u2019s business model. Offering a \u2018one-stop shop\u2019 for most households, and the lowest possible price during a serious economic downturn, have helped the company maintain sales and store traffic. This was clear from the company\u2019s 2020 quarterly earnings, which tracked their historical pattern rather than the general economic conditions. Yes, Q1 EPS dipped, and was down year-over-year, but Q1 is generally the company\u2019s slowest. Q2 and Q3 earnings both showed sequential gains \u2013 and beat the forecasts while also gaining year-over-year. Revenues for 2020 have been stable, between $6.29 billion Q1 and $6.18 billion in Q3.Solid performance and a strong retail niche underlay JPM\u2019s analysis of this stock. Analyst Matthew Boss writes, \u201cMulti-year, we see DLTR returning to a double-digit EPS \u201ccompounder\u201d with top and bottom-line drivers in place at the core DT banner (w/ DTPlus roll-out incremental) and stabilization at the Family Dollar concept.\"To this end, Boss upgraded his stance on DLTR from Neutral of Overweight (i.e. Buy), and sets a $130 price target, indicating confidence in a 20.5% upside potential. (To watch Boss\u2019s track record, click here)The analyst consensus rating here is a Moderate Buy, based on 17 reviews that include 10 Buys and 7 Holds. Dollar Tree\u2019s shares are selling for $108, and their $121.33 average price target suggests a 12% upside from current levels. (See DLTR stock analysis on TipRanks)Mohawk Industries (MHK)As a source of employment, and as an indicator of underlying economic health, few industries get as much attention as home building. And that will bring us to Mohawk, a contractor in the home construction sector, specializing in residential and commercial flooring. The company employs over 37,000 worldwide, and boasts operations in North and South America, south Asia, and Australia.Mohawk\u2019s performance \u2013 in financial results and share appreciation \u2013 has tracked the pandemic over the course of the year. Revenues declined in 1H20, bottoming out in Q2, but have turned back up in Q3. The third quarter top line, at $2.57 billion, was the highest so far in 2020. Earnings followed the same pattern, rising from a Q2 trough to hit an EPS of $3.26 in Q3, the highest in more than 2 years.JPM analyst Michael Rehaut is impressed with Mohawk\u2019s recent performance, enough to upgrade his stance on the stock. He has shifted his rating from Neutral to Overweight (i.e. Buy), and set a price target of $157, suggesting an 18% one-year upside. (To watch Rehaut\u2019s track record, click here)\u201cFollowing nearly three years of relative underperformance, we believe both the sellside and buyside are overly conservative on MHK\u2019s earnings growth prospects over the next 1-2 years. On this point, we note our 2021E EPS of $10.60 is well above the Street\u2019s $9.87 as well as even more bullish buyside expectations that we believe are around $10.00, based on our conversations with investors,\u201d Rehaut noted. Overall, Wall Street remains cautious on Mohawk shares, as evidenced by the Hold consensus rating. This is based on 6 Buys, 4 Holds, and 4 Sells. The stock is priced at $132.60, and the average price target of $116.15 indicates a possible downside of 12.50% for the coming year. (See MHK stock analysis on TipRanks)Northern Trust (NTRS)Last and least is Northern Trust, a financial services company catering to individuals of ultra-high net worth, along with institutional investors and corporations. Northern Trust, based in Chicago, boasts $1.3 trillion in assets under management, and another $10.1 trillion assets under custody. The company has a market cap of ~$19 billion, and claims $152 billion in banking assets.With all of that, however, Northern Trust has been having a hard time in recent months. The company missed the estimates in the Q3 results, with the EPS of $1.32 falling 9.5% sequentially, over 21% year-over-year, and missing the forecast by more than 5%. At the top line, revenues fell 2.2% from Q2, to $1.3 billion in Q3. On a positive note, Northern Trust has maintained its dividend payment during this pandemic year. The company pays out 70 cents per common share, and has done so consistently for the past five quarters. The next payment is due at the start of 2021. Annualizing to $2.80 per share, the dividend yields over 3%, an attractive value in these days of near-zero interest rates.Vivek Juneja, one of JPM\u2019s 5-star analysts, sees the negatives overbalancing the positives on Northern Trust. Accordingly, the analyst downgraded his position on the stock to Underweight (i.e. Sell). His price target, at $90, suggests nearly 6% downside from current levels. (To watch Juneja\u2019s track record, click here)Backing his bearish stance, Juneja sees several key points, including: \"1) [Northern Trust's] P/E premium to trust bank peers is almost two standard deviations above its long term average premium, despite sharp narrowing in revenue growth versus peers; 2) Northern is more vulnerable to money market fund outflows than peers - its disclosed institutional asset management money market fund AUM is declining faster in 4Q, down 7% thus far; 3) Northern has had very little institutional money market fee waivers thus far, but they are likelyto rise...\"All in all, the market\u2019s current view on NTRS is a mixed bag, indicating uncertainty as to its prospects. The stock has a Hold analyst consensus rating with only 2 recent Buy ratings. This is versus 3 Holds and 3 Sells. However, the $96.38 price target suggests an upside potential of nearly 8% from the current share price.
