The deal includes $714 million (\u20ac600 million) to be paid in cash for Mobidiag\u2019s equity and net debt of $81 million. Hologic (HOLX) intends to finance the acquisition with existing cash and by borrowing on its line of credit. The transaction, which awaits regulatory approval, is anticipated to close in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Mobidiag, a privately held, commercial-stage Finnish-French developer of innovative molecular diagnostic tests and instrumentation, develops and markets PCR-based (polymerase chain reaction) tests for severe conditions including gastrointestinal and respiratory infections, antimicrobial resistance management, and healthcare related infections. The Amplidiag and Novodiag platforms are automated instruments, which deliver quick turnaround times ranging from 50 minutes to two hours. Notably, Mobidiag recorded revenue of $42 million (\u20ac35 million) in the 2020 calendar year. Hologic\u2019s plan of investing in assay development to drive growth of the Novodiag platform is likely to be $0.10 dilutive to Hologic\u2019s adjusted EPS in fiscal 2022, slightly dilutive in 2023, and accretive thereafter. (See Hologic stock analysis on TipRanks) Hologic\u2019s International Group President Jan Verstreken commented, \u201cAcquiring Mobidiag will further strengthen our international and diagnostics businesses by enabling us to expand into the large, fast-growing acute care adjacency with a near-patient testing solution that offers ease of use, multiplex capability and rapid turnaround time. We believe that Mobidiag has developed a differentiated platform that addresses many of the historical challenges of multiplexed point-of-care molecular testing.\u201d Following the deal announcement, Needham analyst Michael Matson reiterated a Hold rating. Matson said, \u201cWe believe the Mobidiag acquisition adds a new testing vertical for HOLX, expanding its mostly high volume/reference laboratory-based high-throughput testing (i.e., Panther platform) offering to include sample-to-answer and point-of-care hospital testing for rapid diagnostics (Novodiag platform).\u201d Furthermore, \u201cGiven the financial windfall that has resulted from HOLX\u2019s COVID-19 test sales,\u201d the analyst expects \u201cHOLX to remain active with M&A.\u201d \u201cWe believe that HOLX shares are fairly valued considering its post-COVID-19 earnings power,\u201d Matson added. Hologic shares have exploded 79% over the past year, while the stock still scores a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 6 Buys versus 1 Hold. That\u2019s alongside an average analyst price target of $96, which implies 31% upside potential to current levels. Furthermore, Hologic scores a \u201cPerfect 10\u201d from TipRanks\u2019 Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

The deal includes a cash payment of approximately $714 million (\u20ac600 million) for Mobidiag's equity and net debt of roughly $81 million. Mobidiag develops and markets PCR (polymerase chain reaction)-based tests for acute care conditions such as gastrointestinal and respiratory infections, antimicrobial resistance management, and healthcare-associated infections. The Amplidiag and Novodiag platforms are automated instruments that deliver rapid turnaround times ranging from 50 minutes to two hours. Mobidiag generated approximately $42 million (\u20ac35 million) of revenue in calendar 2020. Hologic intends to invest in assay development to drive the growth of the Novodiag platform. The acquisition is roughly $0.10 dilutive to Hologic's non-GAAP EPS in fiscal 2022, slightly dilutive in 2023, and accretive after that. Hologic expects to finance the transaction with cash on hand and borrowing on its existing line of credit. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year. The Company ended the December quarter with cash and equivalents of $868.7 million. Price Action: HOLX shares are down 0.10% at $72.8 on the last check Thursday.

(See HOLX stock analysis on TipRanks)Following the deal, Needham analyst Michael Matson said, \u201cHOLX\u00a0is a leader in the infectious disease testing market and we believe the Biotheranostics acquisition allows\u00a0HOLX\u00a0to expand into the adjacent oncology market.\u201d The analyst added, \u201cGiven the financial windfall that has resulted from\u00a0HOLX's COVID-19 test sales, we expect\u00a0HOLX\u00a0to remain active with M&A in CY21.\u201d Notably, Hologic has recently acquired Somatex Medical Technologies for approximately $64 million. However, Matson still maintained a Hold rating on the stock, as he believes that, \u201cHOLX\u00a0shares are fairly valued considering its post-COVID-19 earnings power.\u201dCurrently, the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock, with a Moderate Buy analyst consensus based on 8 Buys and 3 Holds.

That means companies that make and operate kits, like Quest Diagnostics Inc. and Hologic Inc., should see steady flows of income as patients line up to get tested, money managers and Wall Street analysts say.As the industry soars near record levels -- up 68% from a March bottom -- it\u2019s still cheaper relative to the broader S&P 500 Index than it\u2019s been in recent years. That means a trend of promising earnings could provide a boost this year and well into 2022.\u201cThere\u2019s a very positive trend out there for investors because Covid is going to be here for a while -- there is no quick fix,\u201d BNP Paribas Asset Management portfolio manager Christian Fay said by telephone.The iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF, known by its ticker IHI, peeled off a record Monday as testmakers and lab companies like Abbott Laboratories and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. were hit by a broader market decline. Despite the recent surge, some on Wall Street think investors still aren\u2019t giving these firms proper credit for the billions of dollars in expected sales.Investors are \u201cclearly discounting the durability of the revenue stream\u201d from Covid-19 tests, according to Needham & Co. analyst Stephen Unger. He sees the testing opportunity providing a boost into at least 2022.\u201cCurrent levels don\u2019t fully represent the recurring nature of tests,\u201d he said in an interview. He also believes these tests will have \u201cextraordinary\u201d returns on investments and high margins.Earnings BoostThe upcoming earnings season could provide a further boost for the industry when Abbott, maker of seven Covid-19 tests in the U.S., and Thermo Fisher kick off quarterly results before the market opens on Oct. 21.For life sciences companies like Hologic, Quidel Corp., and Abbott, Covid-19 testing is \u201cobviously the cherry on top\u201d after record runs, said Fay, whose BNP Paribas Funds Health Care Innovators fund holds all three stocks. He\u2019s optimistic on the outlook for the testing space given expectations for people to get a \u201cflu, Covid, and RSV test on a quick turnaround will lead to more people getting tested more often.\u201dWhile vaccine developers like Moderna Inc., Pfizer Inc. and its partner BioNTech SE, and AstraZeneca have dominated headlines and seen the largest flows of trading over recent months, some investors are preferring to hedge vaccine bets with investments in the diagnostics sector.\u201cI would play out both ends -- diagnostics and vaccines -- because the ability to test to help people get back to normalcy will be key between now and a rolled-out vaccine,\u201d said Amy Kong, chief investment officer of Barrett Asset Management LLC.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b857f0a6b7df31e1a08606136212fba219e32dd10a952b2b006e3412ffb2d360"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1603174370, "headline": "IBM Retirement Fund Buys 2,339 Shares of Hologic, Inc.
