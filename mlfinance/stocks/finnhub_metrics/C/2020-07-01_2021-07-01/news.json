Shares dropped 3.2% to close at $71.46 on June 16. (See Citi stock chart on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nSpiraling Expenses\n\n\n\nAt a recent Morgan Stanley (MS) virtual conference, Citi CFO Mark Mason told investors that Q2 expenses are likely to fall in the range of $11.2 - $11.6 billion, a significant increase compared to the operating costs of $10.4 billion recorded in the year-ago period. The rise is due to the firm's spending to satisfy a pair of consent orders received from regulators late last year.\n\n\n\nIn October 2020, Citi was fined with a $400 million civil money penalty related to deficiencies in enterprise-wide risk management, compliance risk management, data governance, and internal controls.\n\n\n\nMason said, \u201cLast year this time we took expenses down pretty meaningfully\u2026 But we also, as you know, have spend that we\u2019re making in the way of transformation\u201d\n\n\n\nDeclining Revenue\n\n\n\nMason said that the bank\u2019s trading desk will report a decline in revenue by 30% compared to the prior-year period. \u00a0\n\n\n\nHe also noted that the momentum in the firm\u2019s equity trading business will be offset by a dwindling performance in the fixed-income unit.\n\n\n\nMason noted that the current quarter is \u201ca very different place than we were a year ago,\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also stated that government-aided stimulus packages have led to a decline in the overall loan growth of Citi\u2019s U.S. card segment, as credit-card holders continue to reduce the amount owed on the loans at faster rates.\n\n\n\nOverall, Mason expects revenue from the firm\u2019s North American consumer business to fall by around 15%.\n\n\n\nAnalyst View\n\n\n\nFollowing the news, Credit Suisse analyst Susan Roth Katzke reiterated a Buy rating on the stock but lowered the price target to $83 (16.2% upside potential) from $84. \u00a0\n\n\n\nAs per BloombergQuint, Katzke said in a note to clients, \u201cWe think it\u2019s fair to expect the higher level of expenses in 2Q21, with increased investment spending -- key to Citi\u2019s transformation and consistent with new management -- to be the new run rate.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Wall Street community is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 10 Buys and 5 Holds.

It now intends to refocus on its business, plowing \u201call incremental profit\u201d back into technology and hotly contested areas like community commerce, Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang pledged on Thursday.Alibaba executives have sought to put behind them a crackdown on Ma\u2019s internet empire that\u2019s shaved $260 billion off the Chinese internet behemoth\u2019s market value. The penalty imposed in April marked the conclusion of a four-month probe, but uncertainty persists as Beijing continues to rein in Alibaba and increasingly powerful rivals from Tencent Holdings Ltd. to Meituan. No analyst asked directly about what\u2019s to come in the broader clampdown Thursday, though Zhang stressed the company accepted the fine and will move forward.\u201cWe accept the penalty with sincerity and will ensure our compliance with determination,\u201d the CEO said. \u201cDuring the past fiscal year, we have gone through all kinds of challenges, including the Covid-19 pandemic, fierce competition as well as an anti-monopoly investigation and penalty decision by Chinese regulators. We believe the best way to overcome these challenges is to look forward and invest for the long term.\u201dAlibaba\u2019s shares slid 3% in U.S. pre-market trading. The stock is down 31% from its October peak, just before Ma\u2019s now-infamous rant against outmoded regulations triggered a chain of events that torpedoed a $35 billion initial public offering by his Ant Group Co. and started a probe into the e-commerce giant.\u201cThere is still significant uncertainty in Alibaba,\u201d said Andy Halliwell, an analyst at analyst at consultancy Publicis Sapient. \u201cThere is no doubt though that Alibaba have capitalized on their digital and tech strategy in light of the global pandemic, and the rebounding Chinese economy. But it remains to be seen how Jack Ma\u2019s behavior last year will have a lasting impact on brand and investor confidence.\u201dClick here for a live blog of the earnings call.Alibaba is keen to convey the impression that it\u2019s back to business as normal. Ma was spotted this week at an annual staff and family celebration at its sprawling Hangzhou campus, where kids played in ball pits while company mascots posed for photos with employees in cosplay.On Thursday, the company forecast revenue for the year ending March 2022 will rise at least 30% to more than 930 billion yuan, beating the 923.5 billion average projection. That\u2019s a deceleration from the previous year\u2019s 41%, and comes after sales for the three moths ended March came in at a better-than-expected 187.4 billion yuan.Despite the rosy projection, it\u2019s unclear how much the increased investment, which also encompasses areas from local internet services and merchant solutions, may hurt margins. And reliable growth engines are slowing: cloud revenue grew just 37% in the March quarter after a major, unidentified customer pulled out, the slowest pace since 2014.Zhang singled out community commerce -- an area now fought over between a number of deep-pocketed rivals like JD.com Inc. and Pinduoduo Inc. -- as a key avenue to reach lower-tier and rural customers. Executives said Alibaba will be disciplined in spending, without elaborating.\u201cDespite heady predictions, it\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll see an erosion of margins in part due to the investment the business is making in new business ventures,\u201d Halliwell said.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:Alibaba\u2019s regulatory overhang may lift with China\u2019s $2.8 billion fine in April potentially marking an end to the worst of the scrutiny that began in late 2020. Meanwhile it could continue to benefit from the accelerated user and merchant adoption of its online grocery shopping, cloud computing and remote-work applications in the aftermath of the pandemic. Longer-term sales and profit growth could be driven by global expansion and the monetization of newer business segments such as logistics, media and entertainment.-- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here for the research.There remain several other questions Alibaba may have to grapple with in the year ahead. The company joined 33 other tech firms in pledging to abide by monopoly laws and eradicate abuses like forced exclusivity agreements -- actions with as-yet unknown ramifications for growth. More broadly, the Chinese government is debating how to exert greater control over the invaluable online data amassed by its internet giants that have enabled their meteoric expansion over the past decade.The government is said to be considering whether to compel Alibaba to shed media assets that have supported its brand. Antitrust watchdogs are screening its previous investments and could force a divestment if deemed in violation of regulations.Then there\u2019s Alibaba\u2019s finance affiliate -- Ant, a major provider of financing for Alibaba\u2019s consumers -- which is still wrangling with regulators over a forced restructuring that could curb its lending. Its profit in the December quarter rose 50% to 21.8 billion yuan, though the bottom line will remain under pressure because of a requirement to cut back on loans.Alibaba is trying to resume business as normal just as competition ramps up in China\u2019s e-commerce market.Pinduoduo reported 788 million annual active buyers in the December quarter, dethroning Alibaba as China\u2019s biggest e-commerce operator by consumers for the first time ever. On Thursday, Alibaba reported its users had climbed to 811 million in China in the three months ended March.Scrappy upstarts like ByteDance Ltd. and Kuaishou Technology are making inroads into social shopping, chipping away at the growth of its Taobao Live service. Other platforms like Meituan, Didi and Tencent Holdings Ltd.-backed MissFresh have made aggressive investments into their community groceries business, leaving the Hangzhou-based Alibaba to play catch-up in the red-hot sector.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=f8d6e4e6a5ea5999d2e2bd07b02b41d773f0dff4822ab84b116efa236e8eec17"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620959940, "headline": "Mackay Shields Llc Buys Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF, NICE, ...", "id": 67852488, "image": "", "related": "C", "source": "GuruFocus", "summary": "GuruFocus Article or News written by insider and the topic is about: ", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=02fe78771a151c90b16e53763fd9e13b78a0c414b0c1f14dadba9e4c813509e3"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620951699, "headline": "At $159, JPMorgan Stock Has A Limited Upside", "id": 67826448, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?1678017142", "related": "C", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "JPMorgan stock\u00a0(NYSE: JPM), the largest bank in the U.S. in terms of total assets, gained roughly 25% \u2013 increasing from about $127 at the beginning of 2021 to around $159 currently, outperforming the S&P500, which grew 11% over the same period.\u00a0", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c52dbf196ddb390d76c77eb05388a385fb2546c8ee1c79f6d2ccb327a5f0e95f"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620924120, "headline": "Citigroup Inc. stock outperforms market on strong trading day", "id": 67812603, "image": "https://images.mktw.net/im-220105/social", "related": "C", "source": "MarketWatch", "summary": "Shares of Citigroup Inc. rose 1.43% to $75.29 Thursday, on what proved to be an all-around great trading session for the stock market, with the S&P 500 Index...", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b9936449420b7e4ec3acc09231d8773552702f5381f3bc6ffb53c01fcf497d4e"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620922824, "headline": "Citigroup forms energy transition group within investment banking - memo", "id": 67810866, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gXdSj6f6cGGRDiDJp5Secw--~B/aD02MTg7dz04MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters.com/92a026843b4f495b91737cbd0fe86f44", "related": "C", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "Citigroup Inc has created a unit within its energy investment bank dedicated to the clean energy transition, aiming to capture more business from the shift towards a lower carbon economy, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.

He also said the company won\u2019t be selling any of the Bitcoin it holds.The largest cryptocurrency dropped as much as 15% to just above $46,000, before paring some of the retreat. It was down about 6% to $50,980 as of 1:09 p.m. in Tokyo on Thursday. The rush to sell briefly caused outages at some digital-token exchanges. Bitcoin is still up more than fivefold in the past year.Musk\u2019s move comes after Tesla disclosed in February that it had purchased $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and planned to accept it as a payment. That announcement added legitimacy to the cryptocurrency as an increasingly acceptable form of payment and an investment, especially coming from a large member of the S&P 500 with a high-profile CEO who commands a big following among retail investors and the general public.Tesla\u2019s website, which had a support page dedicated to Bitcoin, noted that the token was the only cryptocurrency that Tesla accepts in the continental U.S. Musk has also tweeted frequently about Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency started as a joke in 2013 -- and he quipped about being the \u201cDogefather\u201d before and during his stint hosting the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d show on May 8. He tweeted on Tuesday, \u201cDo you want Tesla to accept Doge?\u201dTesla\u2019s addition of Bitcoin to its balance sheet was the most visible catalyst during this year\u2019s rally in the digital currency. Bitcoin jumped 16% that day, the biggest one-day gain since the Covid-19 inspired financial markets volatility in March 2020.Optimism grew after Mastercard Inc., Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and other firms moved to make it easier for customers to use cryptocurrencies, fueling the mainstream resurgence that took Bitcoin from about $29,000 at the end of last year to as high as almost $65,000 in April.Bitcoin mining is consuming 66 times more electricity than it did back in late 2015, and the carbon emissions associated with it will likely face increasing scrutiny, according to a recent Citigroup Inc. report.Musk is no stranger to considering the issue of crypto\u2019s environmental impact.Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Investment Management LLC published a report last month saying cryptocurrency mining can drive investment in solar power and make more renewable energy available to the grid. Twitter Inc.\u2019s Jack Dorsey retweeted a post on the white paper with the comment that Bitcoin \u201cincentivizes renewable energy.\u201d Musk replied to Dorsey\u2019s tweet, saying simply, \u201cTrue.\u201dMusk\u2019s tweet on Wednesday took many in the cryptocurrency community by surprise, including Nic Carter, founding partner at Castle Island Ventures, and a leading voice among defenders of Bitcoin\u2019s energy use.\u201cSurely he would have done his diligence prior to accepting Bitcoin?\u2019 Carter said. \u201cVery odd and confusing to see this quick reversal.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear what prompted the decision and Musk and Zachary Kirkhorn, Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer, didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email inquiry for comment. Kirkhorn in March added the tongue-in-cheek title \u201cMaster of Coin,\u201d according to a regulatory filing.Tesla\u2019s first-quarter earnings were bolstered by the sale of 10% of its Bitcoin holdings. Musk said last month the disposal was intended to demonstrate the token\u2019s liquidity, and added that he\u2019s retained his personal investment in the cryptocurrency. Kirkhorn said on an earnings call that the company believes in Bitcoin\u2019s long-term value.(Updates markets in the third paragraph.

China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation announced late last month that it has launched an investigation into the company\u2019s suspected monopolistic practices.The shares suffered a fresh blow on Monday after the company\u2019s chief executive officer Wang Xing\u2019s social media posting last week of a classical poem about book burning by the emperor during the Qin dynasty went viral on the internet. Wang later deleted it and said he used the poem in reference to the company\u2019s competitors. The topic with hashtag #MeituanSharePriceSlump# has been read more than 32 million times on popular Chinese blogging platform Weibo.com.The stock plunge on Monday knocked $1.5 billion off the value of Wang Xing\u2019s 11% stake in the food delivery giant, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.China\u2019s technology sector has come under intense regulatory scrutiny in recent months, with Ant Group. Co. pulling a record $35 billion initial public offering in November as it complies with new rules. The Hang Seng Tech Index, which includes many Chinese tech giants, has tumbled about 30% from its February high. That compares with a less than 5% fall for Nasdaq 100 Index over the same period. \u201cSo many headwinds still persist in the Chinese technology sector,\u201d Jackson Wong, asset management director at Amber Hill Capital Ltd., said by phone. \u201cThe policy worry is not just about Meituan. Tech regulations just keep coming in China. The lingering regulatory risk makes forecasting the sector\u2019s growth really really difficult.\u201dWong expects funds to continue to rotate out of the tech sector into cyclical names and sees mainland market stabalization as the next catalyst. \u201cIf the sentiment recovers in the domestic market, investors could buy more Hong Kong tech stocks and regulatory fears may recede a bit. So far I haven\u2019t seen that happening,\u201d he added. Meituan may face persisting stock price pressure in the short term, Citigroup Inc. analysts including Alicia Yap wrote in a note commenting on the Shanghai consumer organization\u2019s statement.User growth at internet platforms may decelerate, possibly causing revenue expansion to slow, while their costs may rise in order to comply with regulatory requirements, after the council said an overemphasis on user traffic by the firms is unhealthy, according to the note.

Gasoline futures erased practically all of its earlier gains of as much as 4.2% on Monday, and oil also ended the session little changed.The impact of the shutdown across the U.S. will vary by region and is likely to cause fuel pile-ups, as well as shortages in the short-term, along different parts of the extended supply chain. With the conduit linking U.S. Gulf Coast refineries to the East Coast down for at least another several days, emergency shipments of gasoline and diesel from Texas are already headed for Atlanta and other southeast cities via trucks. At least one refiner is reducing processing rates in response to the pipeline outage.\u201cThe price action has been somewhat muted so far, given the expectation that it might not last too, too long,\u201d Citigroup Inc.\u2019s Eric Lee said in a virtual webinar on the pipeline outage. \u201cBottom line, it\u2019s bullish for East Coast gasoline and diesel and bullish for European gasoline,\u201d while \u201cthe opposite is true for U.S. Gulf Coast prices.\u201dThe Colonial network is the main source of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel for the East Coast, with capacity of about 2.5 million barrels a day on its system from Houston to as far as North Carolina, and another 900,000 barrels to New York.While the pipeline disruption has so far not made huge waves in futures markets, it proves ill-timed as the summer travel rush approaches in the world\u2019s largest oil-consuming country. Over the weekend, traders were said to be securing barges and tankers to send barrels from the U.S. Gulf to the East Coast, and even seeking ships to temporarily store products in the Gulf if the shut down does last longer than expected. Meanwhile, Total SA\u2019s Port Arthur plant in Texas is already scaling back operations at its fuel-making unit.Despite the muted price action in headline futures, more pronounced movements have cropped up in spot prices and regional differentials. U.S. Gulf Coast spot gasoline prices slipped on Monday to the biggest discount to futures in roughly a year. The premium for New York gasoline against Gulf Coast widened to the largest gap since mid-February.There\u2019s particular concern for southeastern cities where total regional stockpiles of gasoline were already at their lowest in ten years before the ransomware attack, according to U.S. government data. Convenience-store chains in places like Atlanta and Savannah, Georgia, began clamoring for emergency fuel deliveries on Friday afternoon, said Steve Boyd, senior managing director at Houston-based distributor Sun Coast Resources Inc. Rack gasoline prices in Atlanta rose on Monday to the highest in two months.U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration has already extended the time delivery drivers can spend behind the wheel when transporting fuel, and has the option of waiving the Jones Act, which requires ships to be built and flagged in the U.S. and crewed by American workers to transport goods between U.S. ports.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=5e94fc4e7934505653e35e92cafc8ad4199795454dca874a121f1aac7447089e"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620673881, "headline": "Revlon says it has replaced Citi as agent on revolver loan", "id": 67725600, "image": "https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20210510&t=2&i=1561581107&r=LYNXMPEH4911K", "related": "C", "source": "Reuters", "summary": "Revlon Inc said it had replaced Citigroup Inc as its collateral and administrative agent on a revolving loan facility, months after the bank mistakenly sent $894 million of its own money to repay the cosmetic maker's lenders.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3b52cf6158c4d22275e94156fcc9572ea3ef899c1580f83a3f83be87f6296981"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620673835, "headline": "Revlon says it has replaced Citi as agent on revolver loan", "id": 67723255, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ddh8.mVufk85DI.w4Ax4RA--~B/aD02MTg7dz04MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters.com/7ba4ca93945a82869ee741a65cb595ce", "related": "C", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "Revlon on Monday replaced Citi with MidCap Financial, as part of an amendment to a 2016 loan agreement that extends its maturity nearly a year to May 7, 2024.

While ad budgets are expected to continue shifting online, growth is likely to decelerate, and \u201chistorically, that usually isn\u2019t bullish for multiples,\u201d analyst Jason Bazinet wrote.Shares of Facebook fell as much as 4.3% on Monday in its biggest one-day percentage loss since January. Google-parent Alphabet was down 2.9%. The S&P 500 Communications Services index fell 1.6%.Alphabet shares are trading at eight times revenue, the highest in more than a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Facebook\u2019s price-to-sales multiple is nine, nearly twice the average for companies in the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index.Even with the recent decline, the pair are the best performers among the five biggest U.S. technology companies this year. Both reported first-quarter revenue that dwarfed analyst estimates when they reported two weeks ago. Alphabet is up more than 30% so far this year, while Facebook has risen nearly 13%, matching Microsoft\u2019s performance. Both Apple and Amazon.com are negative for 2021.Digital ads have seen robust growth over the past two quarters as the pandemic accelerated a shift toward online spending. However, \u201cthe sell side has extrapolated the recent strength for the next five years,\u201d a view that seems too optimistic, Citi wrote. The firm expects growth will decelerate in coming quarters, posing a risk to stock multiples.Read more: Tech Giants Reap Huge Ad Revenue Growth in First Quarter Among other names in the group, Citi reiterated neutral ratings on both Pinterest Inc. and Twitter Inc, along with a sell rating on Snap Inc. The only digital-ad stock Citi recommends buying is Roku Inc., as \u201cthe connected TV market is still nascent.\u201dWith the downgrade, Citi is now the only firm tracked by Bloomberg that doesn\u2019t recommend buying Alphabet. Forty-two firms still have a bullish view on the shares. For Facebook, there are now 49 buy ratings, six holds, and three firms with a negative view on the stock. The average analyst price target points to upside of more than 20% for Alphabet, and for more than 25% for Facebook.Last week, Bloomberg Intelligence wrote that ad pricing would remain a tailwind for Facebook this year \u201cdue to demand for its ad inventory, while ad-impressions growth could taper slightly amid reopenings.\u201d It added that the social-media company was well-positioned to achieve 30%-plus growth in its core mobile-ad business despite tougher comparisons in the second half of the year.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=365bcd2d63e0431548c08668d85428da688f4ccfb63a76396d863784173525e8"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620664920, "headline": "Citigroup Inc. stock outperforms market on strong trading day", "id": 67769608, "image": "https://images.mktw.net/im-220105/social", "related": "C", "source": "MarketWatch", "summary": "Shares of Citigroup Inc. inched 0.07% higher to $75.13 Monday, on what proved to be an all-around rough trading session for the stock market, with the S&P...", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e595b239488e6a58fd75af1d9ca17ab26e8b16aadf1f19a01edf092e2e5f8aed"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620657522, "headline": "Revlon Replaces Citi on Revolver Loan and Posts Narrower Loss", "id": 67711537, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JARcRUrzn5DIXQQVoLYjsQ--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/837a1995d65da4d9cd18e5b40fe1f758", "related": "C", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- Revlon Inc., the makeup giant that\u2019s reworking its business and its borrowings, replaced Citigroup Inc. as agent on part of its finances in the wake of the bank\u2019s $900 million error on a separate loan.The company tapped MidCap Funding IV Trust as its collateral and administrative agent to work out a one-year extension into 2024 for its revolver, Revlon said in its first-quarter results Monday. The report included a narrower loss and showed some improvement in sales trends coming out of the pandemic, but still missed some estimates, and the shares dropped as much as 10%.The change doesn\u2019t sever ties with Citi, which \u201cremains an important partner for Revlon,\u201d a representative for Revlon said in a statement to Bloomberg, adding the company looks \u201cforward to continuing to work with them in a number of capacities.\u201dCiti assisted on the amendment to the revolver and earned a fee for its work, and it\u2019s still working on the ill-fated 2016 term loan that\u2019s tied up in ongoing litigation, according to people familiar with the matter.

The bank was able to recover part of the sum and lost a court fight with creditors over the remaining $500 million, leaving Citigroup to assume the role of a Revlon creditor.The money came from Citi\u2019s accounts, and didn\u2019t affect Revlon\u2019s existing loans, but the blunder forced Citigroup to answer to regulators and tighten its internal controls.News of the switch in agents came as Revlon reported a narrower loss for the first three months of this year and some sequential improvements. But sales continued to fall 1.8% from a year earlier due to changing consumer habits, rising competition from startups with strong social media presence and the Covid-19 pandemic.Excluding $44 million of estimated impact from Covid-19, the company said net sales would have been positive. Results were helped by e-commerce and the Elizabeth Arden brand, representing a bigger chunk of sales.Total liquidity fell to $129.6 million at the end of the quarter from $249.9 million on Dec. 31. Cash and equivalents dropped to $85.6 million from $97.1 million at year-end.Backed by billionaire Ronald Perelman, Revlon has shuffled its finances to ease its debt burden and buy more time to focus on a business turnaround. It completed a debt exchange in November that eliminated the potential for a bankruptcy filing in the near future.On Monday, the cosmetics company said it\u2019s expanding on a previously announced restructuring of operations that would boost organic sales growth and provide $75 million to $95 million of annualized savings by the end of 2023.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4baa6c9a71c435a59221c606ef4414754d0ed0ee187d6e9200e4658416960a1f"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620655101, "headline": "Amazon Tees Up Jumbo Bond Sale for More Cash It Doesn\u2019t Need", "id": 67711520, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SpYQ8KVUKENM4bZSmwG_tA--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/c4cd040ff132a2f03e4a621461b0eb9c", "related": "C", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is selling bonds to refinance debt and buy back stock, as cheap borrowing costs prove too tempting to resist even for a company with tens of billions of dollars in cash.The online retail giant is issuing debt in as many as eight parts, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.

The group isn\u2019t a party to the case, but the court can consider its views.$900 Million BlunderThe conflict started after Citigroup inadvertently wired more than $900 million to asset managers for the Revlon lenders and then asked for it back. The bank sued firms, including Brigade Capital Management, HPS Investment Partners and Symphony Asset Management, that wouldn\u2019t return the funds. It unexpectedly lost that battle in February.The embarrassing blunder forced Citigroup to answer to regulators and tighten its internal controls. The ruling was a boon to creditors, which had been locked in a battle with billionaire investor Ronald Perelman\u2019s struggling cosmetics company over previous restructuring maneuvers.Read More: Citi Asks Court to Reverse $500 Million Transfer DecisionCitigroup has asked the appeals court to overturn U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman\u2019s decision, saying it \u201csent shockwaves through the markets and generated outcry across the financial industry.\u201d Oral argument in the appeal will be held in August or September.In its brief to the court, the group said the funds \u201cwere not due until the term loan matured in 2023,\u201d and full repayment required prior written notice from both Revlon and Citibank that never occurred and was never questioned. The payment occurred outside of the contract between the investors, the company and the bank, which was acting as administrative agent on the loan. That should have \u201cput a reasonable lender on notice of Citibank\u2019s mistake,\u201d the group said.\u2018Manual Touches\u2019The Loan Syndications and Trading Association offered similar arguments in its own brief, saying the mistaken payment has already \u201csignificantly disrupted\u201d the drafting and negotiation of credit facilities and the expectations of participants in the market. Mistakes will happen because the often automated transactions require \u201cmanual touches,\u201d the trade group said.Furman\u2019s decision letting the investment firms keep the money was based on a 1991 New York state court case, Banque Worms v. BankAmerica International. In that case, New York\u2019s highest court ruled that under a principle called discharge for value, when a third party mistakenly sends money from a debtor to a creditor, the creditor can keep the payment if it didn\u2019t realize it was sent in error and didn\u2019t make any misrepresentations. But the mistaken payment in the Banque Worms case was money due to the creditors at the time it was sent, the group said.Read More: Citi Faces \u2018Finders Keepers\u2019 in Fighting $500 Million RulingThe ruling could have \u201csubstantial, detrimental effects\u201d on the industry, including adding costs and risks in the leveraged loan market, \u201cdiscouraging parties from engaging in collaborative contracting and punishing those who do,\u201d and introducing \u201cuncertainty into both new and already existing leveraged loan agreements,\u201d the group said.The group includes Columbia Law School professors Eric Talley, Talia Gillis and Ronald Gilson, University of California at Berkeley professor Robert Bartlett, University of Michigan professor Albert Choi and University of Pennsylvania professor David Hoffman, as well as Edward Morrison, co-director of the Richard Paul Richman Center for Business, Law, and Public Policy at Columbia.The appeal is Citibank NA v. Brigade Capital Management LP, 21-487, U.S. Court of Appeals, Second Circuit (Manhattan). The lower-court case is Citibank NA v. Brigade Capital Management, 20-cv-6539, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c28cfe306caf7ce31902f7b1f98e19ea73cc4999ac8ae7633dfeef6a3e2071c3"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620405720, "headline": "Citigroup Inc. stock rises Friday, still underperforms market", "id": 67769609, "image": "https://images.mktw.net/im-220105/social", "related": "C", "source": "MarketWatch", "summary": "Shares of Citigroup Inc. inched 0.40% higher to $75.08 Friday, on what proved to be an all-around positive trading session for the stock market, with the S&P...", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=34226a75fc461d6566748ff5a4513bb8cb5878e2288028f5cee9b0f9d7199bb3"}]
