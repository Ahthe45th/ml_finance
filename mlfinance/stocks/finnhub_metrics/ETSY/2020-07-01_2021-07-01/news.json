Furthermore, Etsy itself is slowly losing its\u00a0unique leadership position\u00a0in the handmade craft industry, as Amazon Handmade has entered into the niche market,\u00a0Aftahi\u00a0mentioned.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe analyst was critical of Etsy, saying that the company faces a double-edged sword in regard to its business model. Its\u00a0policies\u00a0mandating sustainability and handmade goods could limit future growth. On the other hand, shifting away from those policies may push away otherwise loyal buyers and sellers toward the website's competitors.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nOn\u00a0TipRanks, ETSY is calculated to be a Strong Buy,\u00a0based on 12 Buy, 1 Hold, and 1 Sell ratings. The\u00a0average analyst ETSY price target is $222.92, representing a potential 12-month upside of 32.44%.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analyst.

(ETSY) has inked a cash deal to acquire Depop, a privately-held marketplace for unique fashion with 30 million registered users across 150 countries, for $1.625 billion.\n\n\n\nETSY operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate and creative buyers and sellers around the world. Shares of the company were up 7.2% to close at $175.14 on June 2.\n\n\n\nPer the terms of the deal, ETSY will pay $1.625 billion in cash after adjusting for Depop's working capital, transaction expenses, cash, debt, and certain deferred and unvested equity of Depop's management and employees. Notably, Depop will continue to operate as a standalone marketplace headed by its existing team.\n\n\n\nThe deal is expected to be accretive to Etsy's top-line growth and will be slightly dilutive to Etsy's adjusted EBITDA margin. (See\u00a0Etsy, Inc. stock analysis\u00a0on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nThe addition of Depop will enhance ETSY\u2019s total addressable market (TAM) in the apparel sector, specifically in the fast-growing resale space, as well as widen its reach into the Gen Z consumer with differentiated brand strength and strong user engagement, the company said.\n\n\n\nThe acquisition is expected to close during the third quarter of 2021. \u00a0Upon completion of the deal, Etsy will function through three highly differentiated eCommerce brands: Etsy, Reverb, and Depop. \n\n\n\nETSY intends to utilize its available liquidity to finance the deal. As of March 31, 2021, Etsy had $2 billion in total liquidity which includes $1.8 billion in cash and investments and an undrawn $200 million revolving credit facility.\n\n\n\nETSY CEO Josh Silverman stated, \"We are simply thrilled to be adding Depop\u2014what we believe to be\u00a0the\u00a0resale home for Gen Z consumers\u2014to the Etsy family. Depop is a vibrant, two-sided marketplace with a passionate community, a highly-differentiated offering of unique items, and we believe significant potential to further scale.\u201d\n\n\n\nSilverman further added, \u201cWe see significant opportunities for shared expertise and growth synergies across what will now be a tremendous 'house of brands' portfolio of individually distinct, and very special, ecommerce brands.\"\n\n\n\nAfter the deal announcement, Canaccord Genuity analyst Maria Ripps reiterated a Buy rating and a price target of $270 (54.2% upside potential) on the stock.\n\n\n\nRipps commented that the deal enhances ETSY\u2019s existing portfolio of brands adding Depop\u2019s strong base of Gen Z end consumers to its user base. It also extends the company\u2019s foothold in the rapidly growing second-hand apparel market.\n\n\n\nOverall, the stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buys, 1 Hold, and 1 Sell. The average analyst\u00a0price target of $224.83\u00a0implies 28.4% upside potential from current levels.

This was evident from Etsy\u2019s (ETSY) outlook, following the company\u2019s latest quarterly statement. While the homemade flavored e-commerce platform delivered another strong display in Q1, investors didn\u2019t like Etsy\u2019s warning of a deceleration in growth for the upcoming quarter. With sales of masks and other Covid-related paraphernalia, Etsy has been a prime beneficiary of consumers\u2019 pivot to online shopping during the pandemic. The boom was sustained in Q1. Revenue increased by 141.4% year-over-year to $550.6 million, coming in ahead of the Street\u2019s forecast by $20.19 million. Consensus called for EPS of $0.88 - Etsy reported earnings of $1 a share. And while analysts expected gross merchandise sales of $3.04 billion, sales rose by 132% to reach $3.14 billion. However, looking ahead to Q2, Etsy anticipates gross merchandise sales in the $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion range and revenue to come in between $493 million to $536 million, a 15% to 25% uptick from the same period last year \u2013 comparatively tame when put up against the triple-digit growth in the prior four quarters. Citing pandemic related uncertainty, the company refrained from providing guidance for the full year. Nevertheless, Oppenheimer\u2019s Jason Helfstein thinks the new buyers Etsy accumulated in the pandemic era will come back for more and the 5-star analyst sees the company having a \u201clong runway of growth ahead.\u201d \u201cAdjusting for mask sales, comps & stimulus checks, GMV growth did not slow from 4Q, with 2Q guidance assuming at most 400 bps slowdown on apples-to-apples basis,\u201d Helfstein noted. \u201cThis highlights ETSY's strong marketplace fundamentals, as repeat buyers +114% y/y. While investors were disappointed with guidance, we view the 84M buyer base as having the ability to scale to materially higher levels. We also see seller services as a natural hedge to re-opening headwinds.\u201d Helfstein remains an Etsy bull and following the report keeps an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on the shares. That said, there\u2019s a trim to the price target, which is reduced from $240 to $200, suggesting upside of 25% from current levels. (To watch Helfstein\u2019s track record, click here) Most on the Street remain in Etsy\u2019s corner. The stock\u2019s Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 10 Buys vs. 2 Holds and 1 Sell. The average price target is more upbeat than Helfstein\u2019s, and at $230.93, could yield returns of 45% over the next 12 months.

This was evident from Etsy\u2019s (ETSY) outlook, following the company\u2019s latest quarterly statement.While the homemade flavored e-commerce platform delivered another strong display in Q1, investors didn\u2019t like Etsy\u2019s warning of a deceleration in growth for the upcoming quarter.With sales of masks and other Covid-related paraphernalia, Etsy has been a prime beneficiary of consumers\u2019 pivot to online shopping during the pandemic. The boom was sustained in Q1.Revenue increased by 141.4% year-over-year to $550.6 million, coming in ahead of the Street\u2019s forecast by $20.19 million. Consensus called for EPS of $0.88 - Etsy reported earnings of $1 a share. And while analysts expected gross merchandise sales of $3.04 billion, sales rose by 132% to reach $3.14 billion.However, looking ahead to Q2, Etsy anticipates gross merchandise sales in the $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion range and revenue to come in between $493 million to $536 million, a 15% to 25% uptick from the same period last year \u2013 comparatively tame when put up against the triple-digit growth in the prior four quarters. Citing pandemic related uncertainty, the company refrained from providing guidance for the full year.Nevertheless, Oppenheimer\u2019s Jason Helfstein thinks the new buyers Etsy accumulated in the pandemic era will come back for more and the 5-star analyst sees the company having a \u201clong runway of growth ahead.\u201d\u201cAdjusting for mask sales, comps & stimulus checks, GMV growth did not slow from 4Q, with 2Q guidance assuming at most 400 bps slowdown on apples-to-apples basis,\u201d Helfstein noted. \u201cThis highlights ETSY's strong marketplace fundamentals, as repeat buyers +114% y/y. While investors were disappointed with guidance, we view the 84M buyer base as having the ability to scale to materially higher levels. We also see seller services as a natural hedge to re-opening headwinds.\u201dHelfstein remains an Etsy bull and following the report keeps an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on the shares. That said, there\u2019s a trim to the price target, which is reduced from $240 to $200, suggesting upside of 25% from current levels. (To watch Helfstein\u2019s track record, click here) Most on the Street remain in Etsy\u2019s corner. The stock\u2019s Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 10 Buys vs. 2 Holds and 1 Sell. The average price target is more upbeat than Helfstein\u2019s, and at $230.93, could yield returns of 45% over the next 12 months.
