(NASDAQ: ENPH), a global energy management technology company and the world\u2019s leading supplier of microinverter-based solar-plus-storage systems, announced today financial results for the first quarter of 2021, which included the summary below from its President and CEO, Badri Kothandaraman. We reported quarterly revenue of $301.8 million in the first quarter of 2021, along with 41.1% for non-GAAP gross margin. We shipped approximately 830 megawatts DC, or 2,452,765 microinverters. In addition, we acquired two companies to accelerate our digital transformation \u2013 Sofdesk, Inc., which provides solar design software to installers, and the Solar Design Services business of DIN Engineering Services, LLP, which provides permitting and proposal services to installers. Financial highlights for the first quarter of 2021 are listed below. Revenue of $301.8 millionCash flow from operations of $75.8 million; ending cash balance of $1,489.0 millionGAAP gross margin of 40.7%; non-GAAP gross margin of 41.1%GAAP operating income of $61.4 million; non-GAAP operating income of $80.2 millionGAAP net income of $31.7 million, including a non-cash loss of $56.4 million on the partial settlement of convertible notes; non-GAAP net income of $78.7 millionGAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.22; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.56 Our revenue and earnings for the first quarter of 2021 are provided below, compared with those of the prior quarter and the year ago quarter: (In thousands, except per share data and percentages) GAAP Non-GAAP Q1 2021 Q4 2020 Q1 2020* Q1 2021 Q4 2020 Q1 2020*Revenue$301,754 $264,839 $205,545 $301,754 $264,839 $205,545 Gross margin40.7% 46.0% 39.2% 41.1% 40.2% 39.5%Operating expenses$61,563 $42,824 $35,963 $43,699 $34,193 $28,508 Operating income$61,386 $79,114 $44,712 $80,232 $72,356 $52,773 Net income$31,698 $72,991 $68,936 $78,702 $71,342 $51,875 Basic EPS$0.24 $0.57 $0.56 $0.60 $0.56 $0.42 Diluted EPS$0.22 $0.50 $0.50 $0.56 $0.51 $0.38 * Revenue for the first quarter of 2020 of $205.5 million included approximately $44.5 million of safe harbor revenue. Total revenue increased 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 as we continued to experience strong worldwide demand for our solar and storage systems. We reported record quarterly revenue in the U.S., Europe, and Australia, despite normal seasonality in the first quarter. Our operations team did an excellent job of navigating component supply constraints to best service our customer demand, while improving inventory in the channel. Our non-GAAP gross margin increased to 41.1% in the first quarter of 2021, from 40.2% in the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by disciplined pricing and cost management. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased to $43.7 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $34.2 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to increased investments in research and development, increased hiring, payroll tax associated with employee stock vesting, and the consolidation of Sofdesk operations in late January. Non-GAAP operating income was $80.2 million, compared to $72.4 million in the prior quarter. We exited the first quarter of 2021 with $1,489.0 million in cash and generated $75.8 million in cash flow from operations. The cash balance includes net proceeds of approximately $1,189.4 million from the convertible notes issuance in March 2021 and is partially offset by $304.8 million paid in principal amounts for the partial repurchase and conversions of the convertible notes due 2024 and 2025. Inventory was $34.9 million at the end of the first quarter of 2021, compared to $41.8 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. The sequential decrease in our inventory was driven by an increase in customer demand coupled with supply constraints. We made good progress on the rollout of our Enphase Storage systems by reducing commissioning times. We introduced 24/7 global customer support and are pleased to resume in-person installer training, while also continuing our online certification. In addition, we recently expanded our Enphase Installer Network (EIN) in the Netherlands and Belgium, after successful launches in the U.S. and Australia. Our EIN installers can enjoy a variety of tools and services on Enphase\u2019s digital platform to help make the sales and installation process faster and easier, while providing an exceptional experience to homeowners across the globe.

The refund request was subject to review and approval by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection; therefore, we assessed the probable loss recovery in the three months ended December 31, 2020 was equal to the $16.5 million approved refund requests available to us. For the three months ended December 31, 2020, we have recorded $15.9 million as a reduction to cost of revenues and $0.6 million as interest income in our consolidated statements of operations as the approved refunds relate to paid tariffs previously recorded to cost of revenues. No tariff refunds were recorded as a reduction to cost of revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. (2) Loss on partial settlement of convertible notes of $56.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 primarily relates to the $9.5 million non-cash loss on partial settlement of $87.1 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes due 2024, $9.4 million non-cash loss on partial settlement of $217.7 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes due 2025 and $37.5 million non-cash inducement loss incurred on repurchase of Notes due 2025. Loss on partial settlement of convertible notes of $3.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020 is related to partial settlement of $43.9 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes due 2024. (3) Change in fair value of derivatives of $15.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 represents changes in fair value of the conversion option in the Notes due 2025, as well as the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. Initially, conversion of the Notes due 2025 would be settled solely in cash as a result of the Company not having the necessary number of authorized but unissued shares of its common stock available to settle the conversion option of the Notes due 2025 in shares; therefore, the conversion option, convertible note hedge and warrant transactions were classified as derivatives that required marked-to-market accounting. On May 20, 2020, at the Company\u2019s annual meeting of stockholders, the stockholders approved an amendment to its certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. As a result, the Company is now able to settle the Notes due 2025, convertible notes hedge and warrants through payment or delivery, as the case may be, of cash, shares of its common stock or a combination thereof, at the Company\u2019s election. Accordingly, on May 20, 2020, the conversion option, convertible note hedge and warrant transactions were remeasured at fair value and were then reclassified to additional paid-in-capital in the condensed consolidated balance sheet in the second quarter of 2020 and are no longer remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification.

The sector is set to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.5%. And solar is no longer a regional phenomenon. Currently, there are over 97 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity installed throughout the country. For perspective, that\u2019s enough to power almost 18 million homes. Source: Diyana Dimitrova / Shutterstock.com The industry has received a boost from federal programs such as the Solar Investment Tax Credit. But there\u2019s also been a drop in the price of the equipment and installation costs that have boosted demand.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips So why didn\u2019t solar stocks move higher until last year? Many solar stocks found themselves fighting deflation of material costs. In fact, if you look at the chart of most solar stocks, they look remarkably similar. All of the major solar companies have faced a selloff to some degree in 2021. One of the leading solar ETFs, the Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) is down about 30% from its peak in January. The only question that clean energy investors have to ask is when to jump in? The sector is showing signs of moving higher. But some analysts say the timing may still not be right. However, whenever you decide to jump in, there are several attractive candidates. Many Companies Have a Bright Outlook For example, you could take a lot of the guesswork out and simply invest in an exchange-traded fund. A solid choice would be the Invesco Solar ETF that we mentioned earlier. Another area to pay attention to is the solar panel installers. Here you can look at Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN). The company recently purchased Vivint Solar which brings together the two largest residential solar companies. And turning your attention to the companies that manufacture solar panels and other solar equipment bring to mind names like First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR). In addition to manufacturing solar panels, First Solar is also involved in some of the support and maintenance for solar power operations. Turning your attention north of the border, you can look at Canadian Solar (NASDAQ:CSIQ), which operates in much the same fashion as First Solar, also in Canada. 7 Retail Stocks With E-commerce Locked In SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG) is an Israeli company that makes power optimizers, solar inverters, and monitoring systems that support residential and commercial solar operations. SunPower Corporation (NASDAQ:SPWR) designs and builds photovoltaic cells and related solar materials. And if you\u2019re a speculative investor looking for an under-the-radar gem, you could consider a company such as SolarWindow (OTCMKTS:WNDW). This company uses proprietary technology that they term LiquidElectricity that applies a transparent coating of organic photovoltaic solar cells to solar panels. The stock was trading for under $5 per share just a year ago, but has made significant gains. However, the company does not yet have a product available, so taking a position carries significant risk. But If You Could Only Buy One, It Should Be ENPH Stock My choice would be Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH). And not just because ENPH stock is up about 330% in the last 12 months. The reason is the company\u2019s microinverter technology. While this sounds really technical, it has an easy-to-understand benefit that every solar panel maker will find useful. A fundamental limitation of solar power is what to do in the evening or on cloudy days. Microinverter technology takes the direct current power from the solar panels and converts it to alternating current power. This allows efficient use of solar power during those times. The economics make this a win for customers. And as opposed to central inverters, they make a solar installation less prone to having a single point failure take down the entire system, which makes the company a hit with solar panel installers. And although Enphase does over 80% of its current business in the United States it is looking to expand internationally. One product that has real promise is its off-grid solar and storage system, Ensemble-in-a-Box, which is being targeted for countries like India because it does not require much infrastructure. Overall, ENPH stock is the most compelling solar stock currently on the market.

(NASDAQ: ENPH), a global energy management technology company and the world's leading supplier of microinverter-based solar-plus-storage systems, today announced that Transdev, a multinational transit operator, selected Enphase microinverters for the first public transport depot in Australia to feature a fully solar-powered bus. Transdev plans to electrify the public transport network in Australia to show that it is more economical both financially and environmentally to transition to solar-powered electrical vehicle (EV) buses. Transdev partnered with REA Global, an award winning residential and commercial solar installer with Platinum status in the Enphase Installer Network (EIN) in Australia. The first stage of the installation paired 250 x 380 W REA Power Series Modules with Enphase IQ 7+ microinverters to deliver this pioneering 95 kW commercial project. \"The decision to partner with REA Global for our solar requirements was simple as Michael and his team provide the most advanced solar technology and industry-leading workmanship and service,\" said Marc Cleave, head of engineering at Transdev Australia. \"Enphase microinverters were chosen as part of the REA Solar solution to help enable us to generate the most amount of energy for the available rooftop space and provide ultimate system safety and accountability with panel-level monitoring.\" \"Being chosen as the key energy partner for Transdev Australia is a great honor and it showcases our commitment to the development and implementation of advanced solar technology,\" said Michael Mrowka, director at REA Global. \"Enphase microinverters are key to this as the technology enables us to create more solar energy from a smaller space with increased safety and reliability.\" IQ 7+ microinverters leverage Enphase's unique software-defined architecture and semiconductor integration for excellent reliability and economies of scale. Enphase microinverters are subjected to a rigorous reliability and quality testing regimen with more than one million cumulative hours of power-on testing to provide exceptional performance under heat, high humidity, salty air, extreme cold, and harsh climate conditions. The Company's microinverters are designed to be long-lived energy assets and are backed by a 10-year limited warranty in the Australian solar market, which can be extended for a fee to 15, 20, or 25 years. Reliability and panel-level monitoring were essential requirements to gather the data needed to drive the initiative forward and ensure optimal performance. Both REA Global's residential and commercial installations are outfitted with Enphase Envoy\u2122 communications gateways, which connect the solar systems to the Enphase Enlighten\u2122 monitoring platform and help make per-panel energy monitoring and insights for operations and maintenance easy. \"I am pleased that Transdev has utilized Enphase microinverter technology to shine a light on the electrified future of public transport,\" said Dave Ranhoff, chief commercial officer at Enphase Energy. \"Transdev's vision complements our mission to usher in a new energy future, and it is through the commitment to quality, service, and innovation by partners like REA Global that the clean energy evolution can be realized.\" About Enphase Energy, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ENPH), a global energy technology company and the world\u2019s leading supplier of solar microinverters, today announced that after successful launches of its Enphase Installer Network (EIN) in the U.S. and Australia in 2020, the Company has expanded EIN into the Netherlands and Belgium, with more European countries to follow during 2021. The EIN recognizes a network of trusted installers that deliver exceptional homeowner experiences using Enphase products and is designed to help Enphase installers grow their business with a range of innovative digital tools and exclusive benefits. EIN members can take advantage of access to an advanced digital platform that delivers sales leads and self-service tools, as well as metrics and analytics that can be leveraged to improve business efficiency and profits. Solar installers can qualify to become a part of EIN in one of three tiers, as Enphase Platinum, Gold, or Silver Installers, based on meeting a range of performance benchmarks including but not limited to homeowner satisfaction and relationship duration. \u201cOur goal with the EIN is to improve the bottom line for our installer partners and give them another reason to continue being enthusiastic evangelists of our products, while providing homeowners with an exceptional experience,\u201d said Dave Ranhoff, chief commercial officer at Enphase Energy. \u201cWe are pleased with our launch of the EIN in the Netherlands and Belgium as the European solar market is an important part of our growth strategy, and we look forward to adding more countries in the region to our EIN later this year.\u201d As part of the ongoing digital transformation at Enphase, the EIN will be backed by significant enhancements to the installer-facing functionality of the Enphase Enlighten\u2122 platform. The digital components available to EIN members combine the power of sophisticated analytics with business growth tools, customer support enhancements, and services that can help installers deliver an outstanding customer experience over the long lifespan of Enphase solar systems. Homeowners in the Netherlands and Belgium can easily locate an EIN installer in their area using the Find an Installer tool. \u201cBespaarmetjedak is a fast-growing organization with a strong focus on delivering quality and we believe this is only made possible by using Enphase products,\u201d said Leon Deckers, founder and owner at Bespaarmetjedak, an Enphase Platinum Installer in the Netherlands. \u201cThe EIN helps provide us with visibility in the marketplace and its use of tracking customer satisfaction through NPS scores provides our customers with the certainty they can expect from our excellent service.\u201d \u201c100%ZON has been working exclusively with Enphase Energy since our inception in 2011,\u201d said Tommaso Puddu, owner at 100%ZON, an Enphase Platinum Installer in the Netherlands. \u201cThe main reasons are safety, insight, and scalability. Enphase is constantly working on innovation, product reliability, and, of course, installer support. This is reflected in the newly developed EIN for the Netherlands.\u201d \u201cWe have been working with Enphase since 2012 and continue to very happy customers,\u201d said Bart Schotman, sales manager at Aalberts Duurzaam, an Enphase Gold Installer in the Netherlands. \u201cAs a proud supplier of Enphase products, we are honored to be part of the EIN.\u201d \"We have been proud Enphase installers since 2011,\u201d said Kristof Lassaut, owner at K.L. Electro BVBA, an Enphase Platinum Installer in Belgium. \u201cWe believe Enphase offers superior products and excellent customer service. With the new EIN, the sky is the limit!\u201d \"At Belgian Solar, quality and satisfied customers come first,\u201d said Wim Dirickx, managing partner at Belgian Solar, an Enphase Gold Installer in Belgium. \u201cOur relationship with Enphase makes all the difference.

(NASDAQ: ENPH), a global energy management technology company and the world\u2019s leading supplier of microinverter-based solar-plus-storage systems, today announced the Company has entered into an agreement with Rubicon Energy to distribute Enphase IQ\u2122 microinverters for grid-tied photovoltaic (PV) applications to residential and commercial installers in the fast-growing South African market. Rubicon Energy, the renewable energy division of Rubicon Group, is headquartered in Cape Town, South Africa with distribution branches located across the country. In order to cater to the higher power modules utilized in the region, Rubicon Energy will predominantly distribute Enphase IQ 7A\u2122 microinverters to residential and commercial installers. Enphase IQ 7A microinverters are grid-tied and compatible with 60-, 66-, or 72-cell solar modules up to 465 W. In addition, all Enphase solar systems distributed by Rubicon Energy will be outfitted with Enphase Envoy\u2122 communications gateways, which connect an Enphase-based solar system to the Enphase Enlighten\u2122 software monitoring platform designed to help make per-panel energy monitoring and insights for operations and maintenance easy. \u201cAfter careful analysis and testing of its products, Rubicon is excited to include the Enphase product range in our offering,\u201d said Nick Roche, chief product officer at Rubicon Energy. \u201cWe have been impressed by all aspects of Enphase and believe it is a great organization with an excellent product offering which is well-suited to the South African solar market requirements. We have found the Enphase microinverter product ecosystem to be refined, easy to install and reliable, all things we know our customers really want. We are very pleased to be partnering with Enphase in South Africa.\u201d \u201cRubicon strives to introduce new technologies and innovative solutions for the South African PV solar market,\u201d said Greg Blandford, director at Rubicon Energy and E-Mobility. \u201cEnphase has been an innovator with its microinverter technology and has a proven track record for quality and cutting-edge technology. The Enphase microinverter 25-year product limited warranty in South Africa is a testament to this. We are very proud to have partnered with Enphase to introduce its products to South Africa and look forward to building on the company\u2019s global success.\u201d As with all Enphase microinverters, the IQ 7A microinverter is powered by Enphase\u2019s unique software-defined architecture and semiconductor integration for excellent reliability and economies of scale. Enphase microinverters are subjected to a rigorous reliability and quality testing regimen with more than one million cumulative hours of power-on testing to ensure exceptional performance under heat, high humidity, salty air, cold, and harsh climate conditions. \"We are thrilled to be entering one of the fastest-growing renewable energy markets in Africa with a partner like Rubicon Energy,\" said Dave Ranhoff, chief commercial officer at Enphase Energy. \u201cOur companies share a commitment to delivering high-quality products, innovative solutions, and a superior customer experience for grid-tied solar. The African continent represents approximately 40% of the world's solar potential, but it currently produces just 1% of the solar electricity generated globally. Our presence in this region is strategically important as we continue to expand our international business and accelerate the transition to a sustainable and equitable clean energy future by using the world\u2019s smartest and safest technology to electrify homes, businesses, and communities.\u201d About Enphase Energy, Inc.
