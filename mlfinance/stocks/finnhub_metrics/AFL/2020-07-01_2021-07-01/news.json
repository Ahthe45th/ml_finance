Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS.Earnings And Revenue Sell-side analysts expect Aflac's EPS to be near $1.13 on sales of $5.50 billion. Aflac earnings in the same period a year ago was $1.16 per share. Quarterly sales came in at $5.54 billion.Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the \"consensus estimates\"; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an \"earnings surprise\", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values.View more earnings on AFLIf the company were to report earnings in line when it publishes results Tuesday, earnings would be down 2.59%. Revenue would be down 0.65% from the same quarter last year.

While transactions from an insider shouldn't be used as the sole item to make an investment or trading decision, an insider buying or selling stock in their company can be a good added factor that leads to more conviction in a decision.Insiders buying stock after a notable sell off can indicate an insider's long-term belief in the success of the company; insiders buying stock at new highs can be an indication the exec doesn't feel the stock is overvalued. Conversely, insiders who are selling stock at new lows can potentially indicate some kind of capitulation moment. Insiders selling at new highs can indicate that exec wants to \"take some profit\" and \"lock in a gain.\"Transaction Codes To Focus On Wall Street tends to focus on insider transactions which take place in the open market, viewed inside a Form 4 filing via codes P for purchase and S for sale. An open-market transaction means the insider went into the market of their own volition and made an active decision about the potential path for a company and its stock moving forward.Transaction codes besides P or S aren't relatively important as they are seldom tied to a decision by the executive. For example, transaction code A is indicative of an insider being forced to sell shares to attain compensation. Moreover, transaction code C indicates the conversion of an option.See more from Benzinga  * Insider Buys Aflac's Shares  * Aflac: Q2 Earnings Insights  * Earnings Scheduled For July 28, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.
