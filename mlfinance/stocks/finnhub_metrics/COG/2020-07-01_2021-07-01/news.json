But not exactly a deal like this one.The merger of Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. with Cimarex Energy Co. announced Monday has confounded investors and analysts, leaving them to question the logic behind a tie-up that the companies say will increase diversification. Cimarex is mostly an oil explorer in Texas and Oklahoma, while Cabot is focused on natural gas drilling in the Marcellus shale basin in Appalachia.Although the two companies are following a path blazed by other shale explorers of late by clinching a deal involving almost no takeover premium, it wasn\u2019t enough to win over investors. Shares of both drillers slumped.Analysts at Citigroup Inc. said the deal -- an all-stock transaction valued at about $7.4 billion -- was an unexpected pairing as it creates geographic diversity, unlike other major industry transactions recently. KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. downgraded shares of Cimarex because of the lack of a premium and what it views as no clear strategic benefit to investors. Bloomberg Intelligence said a Permian-focused partner would have made far more sense for Cimarex.\u201cThis deal comes as a bit of a surprise and may have a less clear story to tell investors,\u201d Andrew Dittmar, an analyst at Enverus, wrote in a statement. \u201cSome investors may wonder why in-basin opportunities weren\u2019t pursued ahead of a surprising multi-basin deal.\u201dDeal-making in the shale patch has picked up following a rebound in oil prices from their pandemic-era lows. The number of U.S. exploration and production deals announced or closed this year have more than quadrupled to about $26 billion from the same period a year earlier, Bloomberg data show.\u201cWe don\u2019t really try to guess how people are going to react,\u201d Cimarex Chief Executive Officer Tom Jorden said in a telephone interview. \u201cThis is a long-term move, and we will win our critics over.\u201dBy contrast, enthusiasm permeated through markets two weeks ago when Bonanza Creek Energy Inc. and Extraction Oil & Gas Inc. announced an all-stock deal valued at about $1.1 billion that will combine assets in Colorado. The merger -- a low-premium deal -- was favored among shareholders, as it aims to build on the companies\u2019 existing footprint in the area. Shares for Bonanza and Extraction surged as a result.\u201cI realize this one is a little different than many of the others,\u201d Jorden said. \u201cWe\u2019re not terribly focused on the short-term here.\u201dDebt-laden oil drillers squeezed by back-to-back oil-market busts have faced the grim prospects of bankruptcy or absorption by a stronger rival. Jorden said the deal -- the largest merger in the U.S. shale patch in almost a year -- was not defensive and will allow the companies to go after bigger acquisitions that they couldn\u2019t have otherwise sought on their own, roughly in the $1 billion to $2 billion range.\u201cThis is an offensive move on our part,\u201d Jorden said. \u201cThis combined financial powerhouse -- we have great flexibility that neither one of us have individually.\u201dThe newly merged energy producer will be renamed and be based in Houston. Jorden will lead the company as chief executive officer, while Cabot\u2019s current CEO Dan Dinges will remain executive chairman.The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter, subject to the approval of shareholders. The deal will give Cabot shareholders about 49.5% of the combined entity, with Cimarex shareholders holding the rest, the companies said Monday in a statement.Shares of Cabot closed 6.8% lower at $16.60 in New York while Cimarex dropped 7.1% to $66.14, the two biggest declines on the S&P Oil & Gas Exploration and Production Index.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d50474f2013377e0d5ab9485d1dbc6b7c974453503ac9b0c07b160e91d873d28"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1621889050, "headline": "Shale Oil Stocks To Keep Getting Bigger After $17 Billion Deal", "id": 68038490, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DJDGiGE0aqxDnBTxVhEWDw--~B/aD01MzM7dz05NDU7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ibd.com/4a3f6b76acd5b10597d0582489bf882e", "related": "COG", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "Cabot Oil & Gas and Cimarex Energy announced an all-stock merger on Monday as shale oil stocks continue to get bigger.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=92a25a2a58cd5896d0271d8cd1736d0a48457d7f66551ac54797fe27ef3ff622"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1621888141, "headline": "US STOCKS-Wall Street climbs on tech gains as U.S. Treasury yields dip", "id": 68038493, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EJqC_3iW1BzezltEAHU7qQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTIwMDA7aD0xMTI0/https://s.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/prod/2021-05/24/60ac0cc9901e2526cbfe836c/60ac0cc9901e2526cbfe836d_o_U_v2.jpg", "related": "COG", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "U.S. stocks climbed on Monday, with the Nasdaq jumping more than 1% as a retreat in U.S. Treasury yields helped lift expensive stocks in sectors such as technology as investors attempt to gauge the trajectory of inflation.

More information about each potential case can be found at the link provided.  eHealth, Inc. (NASDAQ: EHTH)Bragar Eagel & Squire is investigating certain officers and directors of eHealth, Inc. following a class action complaint that was filed against eHealth on April 8, 2020.The complaint alleges that eHealth misrepresented and/or failed to disclose to investors: (1) its highly aggressive accounting and modeling assumptions; (2) its skyrocketing rate of member churn, resulting from eHealth\u2019s pursuit of low quality, lossmaking growth; (3) its reliance on direct response television advertising, which attracts an unprofitable, high churn enrollee; and (4) as a result of the foregoing, defendants\u2019 public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\u00a0For more information on the eHealth investigation go to: https://bespc.com/cases/EHTHCabot Oil & Gas Corporation (NYSE: COG) Bragar Eagel & Squire is investigating certain officers and directors of Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation following a class action complaint that was filed against Cabot Oil & Gas on August 13, 2020.The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company\u2019s business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Cabot had inadequate environmental controls and procedures and/or failed to properly mitigate known issues related to those controls and procedures; (ii) as a result, Cabot, among other issues, failed to fix faulty gas wells, thereby polluting Pennsylvania\u2019s water supplies through stray gas migration; (iii) the foregoing was foreseeably likely to subject Cabot to increased governmental scrutiny and enforcement, as well as increased reputational and financial harm; (iv) Cabot continually downplayed its potential civil and/or criminal liabilities with respect to such environmental matters; and (v) as a result, the Company\u2019s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.For more information on the Cabot Oil & Gas investigation go to: https://bespc.com/cases/COGSuper Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ: SMCI)  Bragar Eagel & Squire is investigating certain officers and directors of Super Micro Computer, Inc. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of Super Micro have breached their fiduciary duties to the company.Super Micro had a precarious few years in which it missed SEC financial disclosure deadlines due to accounting irregularities and was subject to an investigation by the SEC for its accounting practices. The Company\u2019s deteriorating operating performance led to a corresponding decline in its stock price. To combat this, certain Super Micro officers and directors engaged in a scheme to improperly recognize revenue when shipping unfinished product or when shipping to the Company's warehouses. At the same time, the officers and directors falsely reassured investors regarding the accuracy of the Company's financial reporting.Then, in October 2017, Super Micro announced that it would be unable to timely file its fiscal year 2017 Form 10-K. Super Micro failed to file its required SEC filings for the next twenty months, resulting in the Company\u2019s delisting from the Nasdaq and the termination of three members of its senior management.\u00a0Finally, on May 17, 2019, Super Micro issued a restatement for a five-year period (2013-2017) admitting that the Company and its officers and managers were aware of, engaged in, and concealed sales and accounting misconduct motivated by an aggressive focus on increasing quarterly financial results. As a result, Super Micro's earnings per share and revenues were artificially inflated by 32% and $40 million, respectively, and the Company incurred $109 million in investigatory costs.\u00a0The Company is the subject of a federal securities class action and a cease-and-desist order issued by the SEC, which required Super Micro to pay $17.5 million due to its misconduct.For more information on the Super Micro Computer investigation go to: https://bespc.com/cases/SMCI-2Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE: BDX) Bragar Eagel & Squire is investigating certain officers and directors of Becton, Dickinson and Company following a class action complaint that was filed against Becton on February 27, 2020.The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company\u2019s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that certain of Becton\u2019s Alaris infusion pumps experienced software errors and alarm prioritization issues; (2) that, as a result, the Company was investing in remediation efforts to address these product issues, rather than a software upgrade to \u201cmake enhancements;\u201d (3) that the Company was reasonably likely to face regulatory delays in connection with the software remediation; (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Becton was reasonably likely to recall certain of its Alaris infusion pumps; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, defendants\u2019 positive statements about the Company\u2019s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.For more information on the Becton investigation go to: https://bespc.com/cases/BDXAbout Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C.:  Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. is a nationally recognized law firm with offices in New York and California.

(NYSE: VEL), FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE), MEI Pharma, Inc. (NADAQ: MEIP), and Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (NYSE: COG). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided.  Velocity Financial, Inc. (NYSE: VEL)Class Period: Common stock purchased pursuant and/or traceable to the Registration Statement and Prospectus, as amended, issued in connection with Velocity\u2019s January 2020 IPO.Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 28, 2020Velocity is a real estate finance company that originates and manages loans issued to borrowers nationwide to finance the purchase of small residential rental and commercial real estate investment properties.On April 8, 2020, Velocity announced its financial and operational results for the 2019 fourth quarter and full year. The Company stated it had suspended all loan origination operations due to market volatility and that it was experiencing enhanced delinquencies in its loan portfolio and had implemented various strategies to attempt to \u201caddress this challenge.\u201d On May 13, 2020, Velocity announced its financial and operational results for the first quarter of 2020 \u2013 the\u00a0same quarter\u00a0in which the IPO was conducted. The Company stated that its net income had decreased 50% sequentially during the quarter to just $2.6 million.By May 15, 2020, Velocity stock was trading at just $2.53 per share \u2013 more than 80% below the $13.00 price investors paid for the stock in the IPO just four months previously.The complaint, filed on July 29, 2020, alleges that defendants failed to disclose that, at the time of the IPO, the Company\u2019s non-performing loans had dramatically increased in size from the figures provided in the offering materials, as measured by both the amount of unpaid principal balance and as a percentage of the Company\u2019s overall loan portfolio. In addition, defendants failed to provide any information to investors regarding the potential impact of the novel coronavirus on Velocity\u2019s business and operations, despite the fact that the international spread of the virus had already been confirmed at the time of the IPO. The failure to disclose the substantial and growing proportion of the Company\u2019s loans that were non-performing and/or on non-accrual status as of the IPO rendered the statements contained in the Offering Materials regarding the quality of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio and underwriting practices materially misleading.For more information on the Velocity class action go to: https://bespc.com/VELFirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE)Class Period: February 21, 2017 to July 21, 2020Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 28, 2020On July 21, 2020, federal agents announced the arrest of Ohio Speaker Larry Householder and four other persons, including a prominent FirstEnergy lobbyist, in connection with a $60 million racketeering and bribery scheme.On this news, the Company\u2019s share price fell by $7.01, or 17%, to close at $34.25 per share on July 21, 2020.On July 22, 2020,\u00a0Cleveland.com\u00a0published an article entitled \u201cFirstEnergy was relentless in quest to have Ohio legislature bail out the utility\u2019s nuclear plants,\u201d which provided further details regarding FirstEnergy\u2019s illicit activities.On this news, the Company\u2019s share price fell by $7.16, or 21%, to close at $27.09 per share on July 22, 2020.The complaint, filed on July 28, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company\u2019s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that FirstEnergy and its representatives and affiliates had orchestrated a $60 million campaign to corrupt the political process in order to secure the passage of legislation favoring the Company and its affiliates; (2) that FirstEnergy and its representatives and affiliates had secretly funneled tens of millions of dollars to Ohio politicians to bribe those politicians in order to secure votes in favor of Ohio House Bill 6 (\u201cHB6\u201d), a $1.3 billion ratepayer bailout for FirstEnergy\u2019s unprofitable nuclear facilities; (3) that FirstEnergy and its representatives and affiliates had conducted a massive, misleading advertising campaign in support of HB6 and in opposition to a ballot initiative to repeal HB6 by passing millions of dollars through an intricate web of \u201cdark money\u201d entities and front companies in order to conceal the Company\u2019s involvement; (4) that FirstEnergy and its representatives and affiliates had subverted a citizens\u2019 ballot initiative to repeal HB6 by, among other unscrupulous tactics, hiring more than 15 signature gathering firms (and thus conflicting them out of supporting the initiative) and bribing ballot initiative insiders and signature collectors; (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, defendants\u2019 Class Period statements regarding FirstEnergy\u2019s regulatory and legislative efforts were materially false and misleading; and (6) that, as a result of the foregoing, FirstEnergy was subject to an extreme, undisclosed risk of reputational, legal and financial harm.For more information on the FirstEnergy class action go to: https://bespc.com/FEMEI Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: MEIP) Class Period: August 2, 2017 and July 1, 2020Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 9, 2020MEI Pharma is a late-stage pharmaceutical company that focuses on the development of various therapies for the treatment of cancer. MEI Pharma\u2019s clinical drug candidates include, among others, Pracinostat, an oral histone deacetylase (\u201cHDAC\u201d) inhibitor.MEI Pharma and Helsinn Healthcare SA, a Swiss pharmaceutical corporation (\u201cHelsinn\u201d), with which MEI Pharma had an exclusive worldwide license, development, manufacturing and commercialization agreement for Pracinostat in acute myeloid leukemia (\u201cAML\u201d), myelodysplastic syndrome, and other potential indications (the \u201cHelsinn License Agreement\u201d), were evaluating Pracinostat in, among other studies, a pivotal Phase 3 global registration clinical trial for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed AML who are unfit to receive intensive chemotherapy (the \u201cPhase 3 Pracinostat Trial\u201d). The Phase 3 Pracinostat Trial, which was initiated in June 2017, was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that would enroll worldwide approximately 500 adults with newly diagnosed AML who are unfit to receive intensive chemotherapy. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive Pracinostat or placebo with azacitidine as background therapy. The primary endpoint of the trial was overall survival.On July 2, 2020, MEI Pharma issued a press release announcing that it was discontinuing the Phase 3 Pracinostat Trial. Specifically, the Company advised that an interim futility analysis of the Phase 3 Pracinostat Trial, undertaken by the study\u2019s Independent Data Monitoring Committee (\u201cIDMC\u201d), \u201chas demonstrated it was unlikely to meet the primary endpoint of overall survival compared to the control group,\u201d and that \u201c[b]ased on the outcome of the interim analysis, the decision was made to discontinue the recruitment of patients and end the study,\u201d which \u201cwas based on a lack of efficacy and not on safety concerns.\u201dFollowing the announcement, the Company\u2019s stock price fell $0.78 per share, or 18.27%, to close at $3.49 per share on July 2, 2020.The complaint, filed on August 10, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company\u2019s business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) MEI Pharma had overstated Pracinostat\u2019s potential efficacy as an AML treatment for the target population; (ii) consequently, the Phase 3 Pracinostat Trial was unlikely to meet its primary endpoint of overall survival; (iii) all the foregoing, once revealed, was foreseeably likely to have a material negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and prospects for Pracinostat; and (iv) as a result, the Company\u2019s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.For more information on the MEI Pharma class action go to: https://bespc.com/MEIPCabot Oil & Gas Corporation (NYSE: COG) Class Period: October 23, 2015 to June 12, 2020Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 13, 2020Cabot was incorporated in 1989 and is headquartered in Houston, Texas. Cabot is an independent oil and gas company that explores for, exploits, develops, produces, and markets oil and gas properties in the U.S.Cabot primarily focuses its oil and gas efforts on the Marcellus Shale located in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania. Cabot\u2019s gas procuring activities in Pennsylvania have been the subject of controversy for over a decade, with the Company repeatedly denying any responsibility for environmental damage observed in the state.On July 26, 2019, Cabot filed a quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the SEC, reporting the Company\u2019s financial and operating results for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 (the \u201c2Q19 10-Q\u201d). The 2Q19 10-Q disclosed that the Company had received two proposed Consent Order and Agreements (\u201cCO&As\u201d) related to two Notices of Violation (\u201cNOVs\u201d) it had received from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (\u201cPaDEP\u201d) back in June and November, 2017, respectively, for failure to prevent the migration of gas into fresh groundwater sources in the area surrounding Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania.Following the release of the 2Q19 10-Q, Cabot\u2019s stock price fell $2.63 per share, or 12.07%, to close at $19.16 per share on July 26, 2019.Then, on June 15, 2020, during pre-market hours, following a grand jury investigation, the Pennsylvania attorney general\u2019s office charged Cabot with fifteen criminal counts arising from its failure to fix faulty gas wells, thereby polluting Pennsylvania\u2019s water supplies through stray gas migration.On this news, Cabot\u2019s stock price fell $0.67 per share, or 3.34%, to close at $19.40 per share on June 15, 2020.The complaint, filed on August 13, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company\u2019s business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Cabot had inadequate environmental controls and procedures and/or failed to properly mitigate known issues related to those controls and procedures; (ii) as a result, Cabot, among other issues, failed to fix faulty gas wells, thereby polluting Pennsylvania\u2019s water supplies through stray gas migration; (iii) the foregoing was foreseeably likely to subject Cabot to increased governmental scrutiny and enforcement, as well as increased reputational and financial harm; (iv) Cabot continually downplayed its potential civil and/or criminal liabilities with respect to such environmental matters; and (v) as a result, the Company\u2019s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.For more information on the Cabot Oil & Gas class action go to: https://bespc.com/COGAbout Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C.:  Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. is a nationally recognized law firm with offices in New York and California.
