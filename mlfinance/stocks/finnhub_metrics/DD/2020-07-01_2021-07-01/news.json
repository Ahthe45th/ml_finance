The company stated that the exchange offer would expire on January 29, 2021.The offer forms a part of DuPont\u2019s \u201cReverse Morris Trust\u201d arrangement with International Flavors & Fragrances, which was announced a year ago. Under the arrangement, DuPont had agreed to split-off its N&B business and then combine it with IFF.DuPont said, \u201cFollowing the exchange offer, N&B will merge with a subsidiary of IFF and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of IFF, and shares of N&B common stock will be converted into shares of IFF common stock. In the merger the N&B shares will convert into IFF shares on a 1.0:1.0 basis, so participants in the exchange offer will instead receive shares of IFF common stock in the merger.\u201dLast month, Delaware\u2019s Supreme Court upheld a March 2020 judgement of the dismissal of a lawsuit against DuPont wherein the company was accused of massively downplaying the cost of environmental liabilities imposed on spin-off company Chemours. (See DD stock analysis on TipRanks)Following the ruling, Deutsche Bank analyst\u00a0David Begleiter\u00a0raised the stock\u2019s price target to $90 (26.6% upside potential) from $65 and reiterated a Buy rating. Begleiter believes that the ruling will lead to a new cost arrangement between the two companies, which will lessen investors\u2019 concern over DuPont\u2019s PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid) exposure.Like Begleiter, the rest of the Street also has a bullish outlook on the stock. The Strong Buy analyst consensus is based on 6 unanimous Buys. Meanwhile, the average analyst\u00a0price target stands at $74, and implies 4.1% upside potential at current levels.
