Now, it\u2019s the worst heat wave in 70 years.Climate change is contributing to increasingly extreme weather in California. Less than a year ago, millions of people were plunged into darkness in an effort to keep power lines from sparking catastrophic wildfires. This time, dangerously high temperatures are taxing the system, bringing about the state\u2019s first rolling blackouts since the 2001 energy crisis.What\u2019s more, they\u2019re hitting just as the pandemic has trapped people indoors in a state that has recorded more Covid-19 infections than any other place, leaving the powerless with a difficult choice between enduring the heat indoors and seeking relief elsewhere. It\u2019s the latest collision of wild weather and the pandemic simultaneously wreaking havoc upon the world. Last week, Tropical Storm Isaias left millions across the eastern U.S. without power for days, forcing remote workers into coffee shops and crowded parking lots to access Internet.Read More: Blame Climate Change for Heatwave Misery: Green InsightFor Californians, Saturday was the second night in a row that grid operator California Independent System Operator made the rare call to shut off power. An estimated 352,500 customers went dark -- or roughly 1 million people based on the average size of a household. A day earlier, about 2 million people lost service over the course of four hours. And more outages are expected with the heat wave.\u201cI\u2019m pretty shocked by this -- I think everybody is,\u201d said Michael Wara, director of the Climate and Energy Policy Program at Stanford University. \u201cThis has to be addressed with a lot of attention, and fast.\u201dBy noon Sunday, temperatures had already reached 97 degrees Fahrenheit (26 Celsius) in Sacramento. Los Angeles was 92. The grid operator issued a warning that the system may run short of power between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. local time.Toll on PowerExtreme weather fueled in part by climate change has taken a profound toll on electrical grids in recent weeks. Just days ago, millions of people lost power across the U.S. Midwest after a wall of lightning, hail and deadly winds tore a path of ruin from central Iowa to Chicago. Before that, Tropical Storm Isaias darkened homes from the Carolinas to Connecticut.For California, the problem is heat. An unrelenting high-pressure system is pushing temperatures upward, leaving the region facing what\u2019s expected to be its hottest two weeks in 70 years. That\u2019s driving up power demand to extreme levels, making it harder for generating plants to keep pace.Before Friday, California hadn\u2019t imposed rolling blackouts since the energy crisis of 2001, when hundreds of thousands of customers took turns being plunged into darkness, power prices surged to record levels and the state\u2019s largest electric utility went bankrupt. (It went bankrupt a second time last year in the face of crippling wildfire liabilities.)Read More: One Million Lost Power in Storm That Spawned Chicago TornadoThe rotating blackouts on Saturday took Californians especially by surprise. Less than an hour before ordering outages, the grid manager had said that blackouts wouldn\u2019t be necessary. Then a 470-megawatt power plant went down, along with 1,000 megawatts of wind power, and it became clear the system couldn\u2019t meet demand, said Anne Gonzales, a spokeswoman for the ISO.Similarly on Friday, the grid operator ordered blackouts after a 500-megawatt generator tripped offline unexpectedly. A 750-megawatt unit was already down. If both had been in service, the agency wouldn\u2019t have had to call for outages, Gonzales said.\u201cThere needs to be a quick and serious look,\u201d Wara said, \u201cat what our reserves are and the degree of which market conditions are affecting their quality and reliability.\u201dThe abrupt and unannounced nature of the rotating outages made the situation especially disruptive for those affected.\u2018It Was Terrible\u2019Mandy Feuerbacher, an immigration attorney in Los Gatos, saw her lights go out without warning on Friday evening. Her two-year-old twins were up until 2 a.m. crying from the heat. She and her husband moved their beds into the downstairs kitchen, hoping it would be cool enough in there for them to sleep.\u201cThe babies were so hot. They were freaking out. We were really worried about our food spoiling,\u201d Feuerbacher said. \u201cIt was terrible.\u201dSaturday\u2019s outages were at least briefer. Edison International\u2019s Southern California Edison utility said about 70,000 customers were affected by the short-lived event. \u201cAt 6:28 p.m., we dropped load. We de-energized about 70,000 customers,\u201d Southern California Edison spokesman Robert Villegas said. \u201cThen we were directed by CAISO to restore them by 6:44 p.m.\u201dWidespread HeatRegions around the world have been grappling with extreme heat, including parts of Europe and the eastern U.S., where temperatures last month were expected to set records for New York and Boston.Last month tied for the world\u2019s second-hottest July on record and the hottest ever in the northern hemisphere, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But few authorities, if any, resorted to rotating outages.In addition to mass blackouts to protect the grid, a prolonged hot spell could trigger scattered outages as aging utility equipment fails in the heat. Transformers -- the metal cylinders sitting atop power poles -- can break down and even catch fire if they can\u2019t cool off at night. During a 10-day heatwave in 2006, California utilities lost more than 1,500 of the devices, with each knocking out one neighborhood in the process.The National Weather Service has issued excessive heat warnings across California through Wednesday and is forecasting temperatures as high as 113 degrees Fahrenheit (45 degrees Celsius) in some parts. \u201cIt will be a tad cooler on Sunday,\u201d the agency said, but the heat gets worse Monday through Wednesday.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=220bfe3c8e40b9e92217821f8bdc82b9a01ac31766895d991743f4ca669bd07f"}, {"category": "company news", "datetime": 1597543525, "headline": "California Faces Second Night of Blackouts Amid Heat Wave", "id": 45173128, "image": "", "related": "EIX", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- California faces another round of rolling blackouts after the operator of the state\u2019s grid issued an emergency order for utilities to throttle back power to prevent a heat wave from overwhelming the system.It\u2019s the second night in a row that the California Independent System Operator has taken the drastic step as temperatures soar across the U.S. West and people blast fans and air conditioners to keep cool.The outages are the latest example of how climate change and the extreme weather it triggers take a profound toll on electrical grids.

Searing heat has gripped cities around the globe in recent weeks, including Brussels, Paris and New York. Earlier this month, violent winds in the U.S. Midwest and a tropical storm in the Northeast left millions with power, in some cases for as much as a week.Read More: One Million Lost Power in Storm That Spawned Chicago TornadoThe outages in California started at about 6:30 p.m. on Friday, when the state\u2019s grid operator determined through a complex calculation that power reserves had fallen below a critical threshold and called a Stage 3 grid emergency, which triggers what it describes as \u201cload interruption.\u201dThe last time such a declaration was made during the electricity crisis of 2000 and 2001, hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses took turns going dark, power prices surged to a record and the state\u2019s largest utility was forced into bankruptcy.\u201cWe had an energy shortfall,\u201d Anne Gonzales, a spokeswoman for grid manager California Independent System Operator, said in a phone interview late Friday.

The outages occurred for 60 to 90 minutes on a rotating basis through the utility\u2019s Northern and Central California service territory, he said.Edison International\u2019s Southern California Edison utility began shutting off customers shortly before 7 p.m., with about 132,000 powerless as of 7:45 p.m.Sempra Energy\u2019s San Diego Gas & Electric utility said shutoffs were \u201cwidespread\u201d across its territory in San Diego and southern Orange counties.Bay Area RecordTemperatures climbed to a record in parts of the Bay Area on Friday, according to the National Weather Service, with San Francisco reaching 95 degrees Fahrenheit and San Jose at 103.Electricity prices already hit two-year highs as weather forecasters called for extreme temperatures. Spot power prices surged past $1,000 a megawatt-hour across California on Friday evening. Natural gas prices in Southern California more than doubled on the increased need for the fuel for power production, BloombergNEF reported.Grid operators will monitor the situation throughout the weekend and into next week, Gonzales said. The odds of rolling outages on Saturday and Sunday might prove lower as demand is typically weaker outside of work hours.\u201cWe don\u2019t expect one, but we are prepared for one,\u201d California ISO\u2019s Gonzales said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=bc82efab355a9722f2229166ac593eed536d2505a393a7e94e35e831322efa92"}, {"category": "company news", "datetime": 1597458947, "headline": "California Orders First Rolling Blackouts Since 2001 Crisis", "id": 42877477, "image": "", "related": "EIX", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- California utilities are carrying out rolling blackouts across the state for the first time since the 2001 U.S. energy crisis as a prolonged and extreme heat wave threatens to blanket much of the state through the middle of next week.The California Independent System Operator, which oversees the state grid, declared a Stage 3 emergency late Friday, initiating the outages with demand soaring from people blasting fans and air conditioners to keep cool. Temperatures were forecast to reach 112 degrees Fahrenheit (44 Celsius) Friday in the San Joaquin Valley. Los Angeles was set to reach 96.The grid operator didn\u2019t immediately say how many homes and businesses may be affected by rotating outages but said the outages will occur \u201cthroughout\u201d the state. Sempra Energy\u2019s San Diego Gas & Electric utility said 1-hour rotating shutoffs will be \u201cwidespread\u201d across its territory in San Diego and southern Orange counties.The intense heat is hitting at an especially vulnerable time for the region with the pandemic forcing people to remain at home. It\u2019s the first time the state has declared a Stage 3 emergency since electricity shortages plunged hundreds of thousands in the region into darkness, forced California\u2019s largest electric utility into bankruptcy and sent power prices surging to record levels in 2000 and 2001.\u201cThe California ISO is working closely with California utilities and neighboring power systems to manage strain on the grid and to restore the power grid to full capacity,\u201d the agency said in a statement late Friday.California is joining regions around the world that have been grappling with extreme weather brought on by climate change in recent months. What was forecast as one of the worst heat waves in more than a century gripped parts of Europe in August. The eastern U.S. is just emerging from July temperatures that were expected to topple daily records in Manhattan and Boston dating to the 19th century.Fire CutoffsThe rolling outages in California also come less than a year after utilities in the region deliberately cut off power to millions of customers in an effort to prevent their power lines from igniting wildfires amid unusually strong winds -- another consequence of increasingly extreme weather.The state won\u2019t see a respite from the high temperatures until later next week as the National Weather Service forecast a long-duration heat wave starting this weekend. The weather agency posted excessive heat warnings for much of California for Friday through Wednesday.Further complicating matters, cloud cover from the remnants of tropical storm Elida is expected to crimp output from the state\u2019s solar generators, leading to tighter supplies, the grid operator said in a statement Friday.Electricity prices have already hit two-year highs as weather forecasters called for extreme temperatures. Spot power prices surged past $1,000 a megawatt-hour across California on Friday evening. Natural gas prices in Southern California more than doubled on the increased need for the fuel for power production, according to report from BloombergNEF.(Updates with scope of outages in third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3de6332c65f8710dc6bc7380a2d918f6d5b1620338dcb5eb921451df8e04ead9"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1597408977, "headline": "BUZZ-U.S. STOCKS ON THE MOVE-CureVac, Tesla, Mesoblast", "id": 61104067, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2020-08-14T105527Z_1_ZV8_RTRLXPP_2_LYNXPACKAGER.JPG?1805335700", "related": "EIX", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "A compilation of the most active stocks on U.S. exchanges.
