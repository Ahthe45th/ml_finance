For some, it\u2019s a focus that lasts a lifetime. For others, their interest is fleeting. In any regard, these holdings play a large role when it comes to how the individual investor deploys their capital. As you\u2019ll see in some of the examples below, many of these stocks have been big-time winners over the decades. However, those returns inflate even more once the dividend is taken into consideration. In many cases, a company\u2019s dividend can be fleeting. Many end up needed to cut the dividend because the business environment became too difficult, because a recession occurred or cash flows tightened. In many cases, these companies may not eliminate the dividend. Instead, they may simply reduce the payout or take a couple years off from giving it a raise.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 7 Great Stocks to Buy Under $10 However, nothing is better than owning a stake in a consistent business with great leadership, that gives us a raise each year. Let\u2019s look at seven dividend stocks with more than 50 years of rising dividends: Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) 3M Co (NYSE:MMM) Federal Realty Trust (NYSE:FRT) Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) Lowe\u2019s (NYSE:LOW) Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW) Dividend Stocks: Procter & Gamble (PG) Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com Consecutive Annual Dividend Raises: 64 Let\u2019s begin this list with the company that has the longest streak of the stocks we chose: P&G. The company has made its dividend raise a habit at this point, with more than six decades of consecutive increases. Investors can count on the sun rising in the east, setting in the west and Procter & Gamble raising its dividend each year. Over the years, Procter & Gamble has cemented itself as a staple in the consumer packaged goods business. The company has found a way into nearly every corner of the consumer\u2019s home. Whether that\u2019s paper towels or toilet paper, baby wipes or diapers, tampons, toothpaste, razor blades, shampoo, laundry detergent, dish soap \u2014 you name it. These products are essential. It doesn\u2019t matter if we\u2019re in a booming economy or a deep recession. Either way, consumers are still going to use deodorant and brush their teeth. Thus, P&G has raised its dividend for decades on end. Look for that to continue. 3M Co (MMM) Source: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com Consecutive Annual Dividend Raises: 63 3M Company doesn\u2019t lag far beyond Procter & Gamble in the dividend department. Kicking out a 3.1% dividend yield and this one is on income investors\u2019 radar. This stock has not had the best performance, though. While shares are up nicely from the March 2020 low, they remain about 26% off the all-time high, set in January 2018. The stock was locked in a multi-year downtrend before the novel coronavirus swept around the world. 3M has not been firing on all cylinders, although the industrial and consumer goods company has really turned things around lately. Analysts expect decent growth, too. Revenue forecasts call for growth of 6.7% and 4% this year and next year, respectively. That\u2019s alongside roughly 10% and 9% earnings growth estimates in those years, respectively. 7 Great Stocks to Buy Under $10 Shares trade at a reasonable 20 times earnings. That\u2019s not a bad valuation for this type of growth and the dependability that comes with 3M\u2019s dividend. Further, the stock is taking out last year\u2019s high and looks to have some decent momentum on the technical side. Federal Realty Trust (FRT) Source: Shutterstock Consecutive Annual Dividend Raises: 53 Federal Realty is one of the most interesting names on this list, in my humble opinion. Over the years, Federal Realty has become one of the most coveted blue-chip REITs in the business. With more than five decades of consecutive dividend increases, there\u2019s not many companies in the industry that can challenge FRT. When we run into dividend stocks with this many years of consecutive increases, it can be hard to find a meaty payout. Despite the rebound we\u2019ve seen in the stock price \u2013 Federal Realty is up 62% from the 2020 lows \u2013 it still has a solid yield of 4.1%. This diversified real estate player has a proven history of strong operations and dependable income. To put this stock\u2019s yield in a bit more perspective, FRT hasn\u2019t had a yield north of 3.6% in the past 10 years. That is, until 2020. Given the beating that the REIT space took last year, it looks like a solid opportunity for long-term investors. Dividend Stocks: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Source: Niloo / Shutterstock.com Consecutive Annual Dividend Raises: 58 This company truly has a lot going for it. Not only is J&J a dependable dividend stalwart with almost six decades of consecutive pay increases, it\u2019s a staple in the healthcare sector, too. With multiple business units within this space, J&J has its patients covered. Whether that\u2019s medical equipment in the hospital or at-home care via Tylenol and Band-Aids, the company\u2019s products are dependable. The company has a foothold in the pharma space, medical devices and consumer products \u2013 all with relatively wide-ranging reach. It\u2019s one reason this stock commands a $432 billion market capitalization. However, its latest accomplishment may be one of the most commendable. J&J has developed a vaccine for Covid-19. It\u2019s now one of three companies vaccinating against the vaccine here in the U.S., joining Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA). While the U.S. has tremendous vaccination momentum, the rest of the world isn\u2019t quite there yet. That should pave a nice runway for companies like Johnson & Johnson as its ramps up production. 7 Great Stocks to Buy Under $10 With that in motion, investors can turn their attention to the company\u2019s next dividend hike \u2013 likely due up in April. Lowe\u2019s (LOW) Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com Consecutive Annual Dividend Raises: 58 The momentum in the housing market is breathtaking. Low interest rates, supply chain disruptions due to Covid-19, an exodus out of larger cities and rent moratorium have allowed the housing market to boom. That\u2019s been a major catalyst for home improvement retailers like Lowe\u2019s. As with J&J, the company is just a few years shy of six consecutive decades of dividend increases. So not only can we count on Lowe\u2019s for solid execution, but we can also expect a bump to the dividend each year. While revenue growth is stagnating, the earnings growth is there. Analysts expect the bottom line to increase almost 10% this year, followed by an acceleration up to 13.7% growth in 2022. Unlike many dividend stocks, this name has been enjoying a huge rally over the past year. Shares are fresh off new all-time highs and have surged from the 2020 lows, up about 225%. Obviously no one expects Lowe\u2019s to repeat that performance in the next 12 months. But it\u2019s shown that there is serious demand for this dividend stalwart, although it now yields just 1.25% after the stock\u2019s run. I guess that\u2019s the price you pay after a stock has tripled in less than a year. Coca-Cola (KO) Source: Soloviov Vadym / Shutterstock.com Consecutive Annual Dividend Raises: 59 It shouldn\u2019t be too surprising to see Coca-Cola make the list here. The company is a long-held stalwart when it comes to investing. Its slow and steady nature has won the appraise of millions \u2013 including Warren Buffett. While it may not be a high-flying tech stock, Coca-Cola\u2019s consistency over the years has won over many investors. On the verge of 60 consecutive dividend raises will help in that regard. In fact, because of Coca-Cola stock, the small town of Quincy, Florida, became filled with millionaires. They were busy gobbling up shares of stock during the depression, at the urging of one of the town\u2019s trusted bankers. 7 Great Stocks to Buy Under $10 This year is setting up as a good one for the company, too. Analysts expect 11.2% revenue growth and almost 10% earnings growth. If Coca-Cola has proven anything \u2013 whether it\u2019s a depression in the 1920s or a pandemic in 2020 \u2013 it can survive just about anything thrown its way. Dividend Stocks: Illinois Tool Works (ITW) Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com Consecutive Annual Dividend Raises: 57 Last, but certainly not least, on our list of dividend stocks is Illinois Tool Works. I absolutely love this stock, because it emphasizes just how well investors can do if they\u2019re patient and stick with quality over the long haul. Shares are up more than 3,200% in the last 30 years and 30,000% in the last 50 years. Granted, those are incredibly long hold times compared to the average investor. However, it emphasizes just how much wealth a great company can produce over several decades. Not to turn this into a stat-fest, but I think it\u2019s an important reminder of what dividends can do. If we shift our focus from the stock-price return \u2013 such as the returns I mentioned above \u2013 to total return, meaning it includes the dividends, then those 30-year and 50-year returns explode to 5,600% and 56,400%, respectively. Despite all that strength, the company is still going strong. Consensus estimates call for 19.5% earnings growth this year and 9.5% growth next year. Here\u2019s to the next 50 years of stellar returns.

Ratings come from analysts, or specialists within banking and financial systems that report for specific stocks or defined sectors (typically once per quarter for each stock). Analysts usually derive their information from company conference calls and meetings, financial statements, and conversations with important insiders to reach their decisions. Analysts also give out recommendations like \"buy\", \"sell\", \"hold\", or similar verbage for each stock based on their overall evaluations of the corres ponding company. A \"buy\" indicates that an analyst is optimistic about a stock's short-term or mid-term growth, recommending traders to purchase the stock. Contrastingly, a \"sell\" means that an analyst believes the stock will trend downwards in that same time frame. A \"hold\" suggests that investors should not buy more of or sell any of the specified stock due to that analyst's prediction of stagnation. Some analysts will also offer forecasts for metrics like growth estimates, earnings, and revenue to provide further guidance on stocks. Investors who use analyst ratings should note that this specialized advice comes from humans and may be subject to error.

That\u2019s why stocks like FRT are permanent fixtures in investment portfolios. Then how can you make a case for dumping FRT stock? Well, it has a lot to do with its portfolio. It is highly invested in shopping centers and retail properties across the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, California, and South Florida. Due to the dominance of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), retail was already under major threat even before the pandemic. However, the virus led to major shutdowns across the retail sector, hastening bankruptcies. Admittedly, FRT has done well to weather the storm. Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2020 came in at $1.22. It has received roughly 89% of total fourth-quarter 2020 billed recurring rents. However, by all intents, the markets have already rewarded the REIT for this positive performance. As of this writing, shares are up 57.81% from their 52-week low. Considering the long-term headwinds and price appreciation, FRT stock is among my stocks to avoid. Carnival (CCL) Source: Kokoulina / Shutterstock.com No surprises that this list would include the world\u2019s largest travel leisure company. The virus was brutal on cruise lines. And even though vaccines are rolling out, it will be a long time before we see numbers return to pre-pandemic levels. Regarding when we will see broader reopenings, no one can say for sure. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended people avoid traveling on cruise lines for the time being, considering the nature of the disease and the higher likelihood of transmission because of so many people crammed into one space. Carnival\u2019s earnings affirm that narrative. In the last two quarters, EPS went into the red. And it doesn\u2019t look like we will see a recovery anytime soon. 7 of the Best Warren Buffett Stock Picks of the Past Decade Carnival has canceled all sailings through May while also cutting trips departing from Australia and Europe. Meanwhile, the company continues to raise capital as ships remain at bay. Most recently, it said it would sell $1 billion in fresh stock to shore up its balance sheet. Debt and equity raises are not new to the sector. However, such equity dilution is never good. Plus, considering that CCL stock is up 26.5%, there is little to no upside left at this point. Slack Technologies (WORK) Source: Shutterstock In 2013, Slack launched to great fanfare. What followed was a typical Big Tech success story that culminated in a $27.7 billion acquisition by Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). However, its bull run has made several investors squeamish from investing in WORK stock at the moment. Shares are down 4%. Slack is a mature company. Even though it has an enviable software-as-a-service model, its revenue prospects are priced in. Competitors are emerging as well, the most notable of which is Quill, a messaging app for co-workers to communicate with each other regarding their tasks. That\u2019s why it\u2019s best to pass on WORK stock at the moment. And if you have a sizeable position, take profits and invest in other high-growth areas. Marriott International (MAR) Source: MariaX / Shutterstock.com A bellwether in the hospitality industry, it\u2019s not surprising that Marriott is on this list of stocks to avoid. Bookings are down across the board, and travel has plummeted. However, the hotelier is such a large company; I don\u2019t expect survival as a major issue. At the end of last year, total liquidity came to almost $4.4 billion, out of which $3.6 billion represents unused borrowings under its revolving credit facility and $0.8 billion in available cash. However, the major issue for the company is demand. In the fourth quarter, net loss was $164 million, compared to reported net income of $279 million in the year-ago period. Revenues came in at $2.17 billion, missing earnings estimates by $228.54 million, per Seeking Alpha data. The precipitous decline in revenues occurred throughout the year, falling 60.6% last year. That had a bearing on each of the quarters, and the recovery is expected to be muted. 7 Index Funds to Buy For March Looking ahead, Refinitiv is projecting for sales to increase by 20.5% in fiscal 2021. Hardly the triple-digit growth most would be looking for. The average price target per TipRanks is $136.36 a pop based on 12 analysts, a 7.91% downside. Considering the risks at the moment, I would not put my money on this one. American Airlines (AAL) Source: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.com We polish off this list with another institution. By several accounts, American Airlines is the world\u2019s largest airline. Considering its size, it\u2019s not surprising that the company faced so many issues when this crisis started. With passenger demand plummeting, AAL was caught unawares. It already had a lot of outstanding debt on its balance sheet when the crisis started. And unfortunately, the legacy carrier spent $12 billion on stock buybacks during the good times. All of these things contributed to a massive liquidity crisis for the company. It has done well to streamline its operations and balance sheet. However, with passenger demand still not recovering to pre-pandemic levels, it will be a tough ask for AAL to navigate out of this crisis. Sadly, for all these reasons, the airline makes it on my list of stocks to avoid.
