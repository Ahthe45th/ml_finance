We believe our unique portfolio of tower, small cell and fiber assets positions us to benefit from what we expect will be a decade-long investment cycle as our customers develop next-generation wireless networks. As a result, we expect the deployment of 5G in the U.S. to extend our opportunity to create long-term value for our shareholders while delivering dividend per share long-term growth of 7% to 8% per year. \"We believe our ability to offer towers, small cells and fiber solutions, which are all integral components of communications networks and are shared among multiple tenants, provides us the best opportunity to generate significant growth while delivering high returns for our shareholders. Based on the expected growth in data traffic and wireless carrier network investment, we believe the U.S. represents the highest growth and lowest risk market in the world for communications infrastructure ownership, and we are pursuing that opportunity with our comprehensive offering.\" RESULTS FOR THE QUARTERThe table below sets forth select financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020.

HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE QUARTER Site rental revenues. Site rental revenues grew 5%, or $59 million, from first quarter 2020 to first quarter 2021, inclusive of approximately $82 million in Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues and a $24 million decrease in straight-lined revenues. The $82 million in Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues represents approximately 6.3% growth, comprised of approximately 9.4% growth from new leasing activity and contracted tenant escalations, net of approximately 3.1% from tenant non-renewals.Net income. Net income for the first quarter 2021 was $121 million compared to $185 million for the first quarter 2020 and was impacted by a $143 million loss on the retirement of long-term obligations due to first quarter 2021 refinancing activities.AFFO per share. AFFO per share for the first quarter 2021 was $1.71, representing 20% growth when compared to $1.42 for the first quarter 2020.Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $302 million, comprised of $17 million of sustaining capital expenditures and $285 million of discretionary capital expenditures. Discretionary capital expenditures during the quarter primarily included approximately $225 million attributable to Fiber and approximately $49 million attributable to Towers.Common stock dividend. During the quarter, Crown Castle paid common stock dividends of approximately $588 million in the aggregate, or $1.33 per common share, an increase of approximately 11% on a per share basis compared to the same period a year ago.Financing Activities. During the quarter, Crown Castle issued $3.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes with a combination of 5-year, 10-year and 20-year maturities, resulting in a weighted average maturity and coupon of 12 years and approximately 2.1%, respectively. Net proceeds from the offering were used to redeem all of the outstanding 5.25% Senior Notes, repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under the 2016 Term Loan A, and repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper notes at their maturity date. \"We are excited about the increasing level of activity we see in our business as our customers have begun to deploy 5G at scale,\" stated Dan Schlanger, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer. \"We believe we are well positioned to support our growing number of customers by providing a comprehensive set of solutions across towers, small cells and fiber solutions, which are all necessary to build out 5G wireless networks. Looking forward, we believe we are in a great position to deliver on our long-term annual dividend growth target of 7% to 8% while at the same time making significant investments in our business that we believe will generate attractive long-term returns and support future growth. To help fund that growth, we were able to opportunistically access the bond market during the first quarter to refinance upcoming maturities, extending our maturity profile and reducing our overall cost of capital. We continue to take steps to complement our compelling total return opportunity with a lower risk profile, and we expect to have sufficient capacity to once again fund our discretionary investments this year with free cash flow and incremental borrowings.\" OUTLOOK This Outlook section contains forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Information regarding potential risks which could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements herein is set forth below and in Crown Castle's filings with the SEC. The following table sets forth Crown Castle's current Outlook for full year 2021.

The increase to the midpoint of the full year 2021 Outlook for site rental revenues, adjusted EBITDA, and AFFO primarily reflect: 1) $140 million of additional straight-lined revenues associated with a long-term tower leasing agreement with Verizon that became effective April 1, 2021 and also resulted in an increase of the average contracted lease term under our existing Verizon tower site leases to approximately 10 years; 2) a $25 million increase in the expected services contribution; and 3) a $30 million decrease in expected interest expense, offset by $15 million of additional labor related costs associated with higher Towers activity than previously expected.The chart below reconciles the components of expected growth in site rental revenues from 2020 to 2021 of $355 million to $400 million, inclusive of expected Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues during 2021 of $295 million to $335 million, or approximately 6%, which is unchanged from our previously provided 2021 Outlook.Chart 1: https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/6ca126e8-06ee-4085-9092-cb9946b7c925 The chart below reconciles the components of expected growth in AFFO from 2020 to 2021 of $340 million to $385 million, adjusted to exclude the impact of the Nontypical Items discussed in our press release dated January 27, 2021.Chart 2: https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/7360bb17-f95a-4126-8353-a7d50d70972cAdditional information is available in Crown Castle's quarterly Supplemental Information Package posted in the Investors section of our website.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Segment Measures and Other Calculations This press release includes presentations of Net income (as adjusted), including per share\u2014diluted amounts, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Funds from Operations (\"AFFO\"), including per share amounts, Funds from Operations (\"FFO\"), including per share amounts, and Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\")). Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the communications infrastructure sector or other real estate investment trusts (\"REITs\"). Our definition of FFO is consistent with guidelines from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. In addition to the non-GAAP financial measures used herein, we also provide Segment Site Rental Gross Margin, Segment Services and Other Gross Margin and Segment Operating Profit, which are key measures used by management to evaluate our operating segments. These segment measures are provided pursuant to GAAP requirements related to segment reporting. In addition, we provide the components of certain GAAP measures, such as capital expenditures. Our non-GAAP financial measures are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our business. Among other things, management believes that: Net Income (as adjusted), including per share\u2014diluted amounts, is useful to investors and other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors as it adjusts net income to exclude the impact of the Nontypical Items (as defined in this press release and described further in our press release dated January 27, 2021), which management believes are unusual (including with respect to magnitude), infrequent and not reasonably likely to recur in the near term, to provide further insight into our results of operations and underlying trends and projections. Management also believes that identifying the impact of Nontypical Items as adjustments provides more transparency and comparability across periods. There can be no assurances that such items will not recur in future periods. Net income (as adjusted), including per share\u2014diluted amounts should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of the communications infrastructure sector and other REITs to measure financial performance without regard to items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. Separately, we are also disclosing Adjusted EBITDA as adjusted to exclude the impact of Nontypical Items, which management believes are unusual (including with respect to magnitude), infrequent and not reasonably likely to recur in the near term, to provide further insight into our results of operations and underlying trends and projections. Management also believes that identifying the impact of Nontypical Items as adjustments provides increased transparency and comparability across periods. There can be no assurances that such items will not recur in future periods. Adjusted EBITDA (including as further adjusted to exclude Nontypical Items) should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.AFFO, including per share amounts, is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that AFFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as it includes (1) the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt and dividends on our preferred stock (in periods where applicable)) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures, and excludes the impact of our (a) asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) and (b) certain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed escalations and rent free periods. GAAP requires rental revenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be recognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment terms call for fixed escalations, or rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the contract. Management notes that Crown Castle uses AFFO only as a performance measure. Separately, we are also disclosing AFFO as adjusted to exclude the impact of Nontypical Items, which management believes are unusual (including with respect to magnitude), infrequent and not reasonably likely to recur in the near term, to provide further insight into our results of operations and underlying trends and projections. Management also believes that identifying the impact of Nontypical Items as adjustments provides increased transparency and comparability across periods. There can be no assurances that such items will not recur in future periods. AFFO (including as further adjusted to exclude Nontypical Items) should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary investment.FFO, including per share amounts, is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that FFO may be used by investors or other interested parties as a basis to compare our financial performance with that of other REITs. FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate financial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion). FFO is not a key performance indicator used by Crown Castle. FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operations.Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues is useful to investors or other interested parties in understanding the components of the year-over-year changes in our site rental revenues computed in accordance with GAAP. Management uses the Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues to assess year-over-year growth rates for our rental activities, to evaluate current performance, to capture trends in rental rates, new leasing activities and tenant non-renewals in our core business, as well to forecast future results. Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues is not meant as an alternative measure of revenue and should be considered only as a supplement in understanding and assessing the performance of our site rental revenues computed in accordance with GAAP. We define our non-GAAP financial measures, segment measures and other calculations as follows: Non-GAAP Financial Measures Net Income (as adjusted). We define Net Income (as adjusted) as net income (loss) less other operating income resulting from the Nontypical Items, plus incremental operating expenses and asset write-downs as a result of the Nontypical Items. Net Income (as adjusted) per share\u2014diluted. We define net income (as adjusted) per share\u2014diluted as Net Income (as adjusted), divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding. Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, (gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations, net (gain) loss on interest rate swaps, (gains) losses on foreign currency swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest income, other (income) expense, (benefit) provision for income taxes, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, (income) loss from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense. Separately, Adjusted EBITDA, as adjusted to exclude the impact of Nontypical Items, reflects Adjusted EBITDA, less other operating income resulting from the Nontypical Items, plus incremental operating expenses as a result of the Nontypical Items. Adjusted Funds from Operations. We define Adjusted Funds from Operations as FFO before straight-lined revenue, straight-lined expense, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash portion of tax provision, non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of non-cash interest expense, other (income) expense, (gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations, net (gain) loss on interest rate swaps, (gains) losses on foreign currency swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, acquisition and integration costs, restructuring charges (credits), cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, (income) loss from discontinued operations and adjustments for noncontrolling interests, less sustaining capital expenditures. Separately, Adjusted Funds from Operations, as adjusted to exclude the impact of Nontypical Items, reflects Adjusted Funds from Operations, less other operating income resulting from the Nontypical Items, plus incremental operating expenses as a result of the Nontypical Items. AFFO per share. We define AFFO per share as AFFO, including as adjusted to exclude the impact of Nontypical Items, divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding. Funds from Operations. We define Funds from Operations as net income plus real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset write-down charges, less noncontrolling interest and cash paid for preferred stock dividends (in periods where applicable), and is a measure of funds from operations attributable to CCIC common stockholders. FFO per share. We define FFO per share as FFO divided by the diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding. Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues. We define the Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues as the sum of the change in GAAP site rental revenues related to (1) new leasing activity, including revenues from the construction of small cells and the impact of prepaid rent, (2) escalators and less (3) non-renewals of tenant contracts. Segment Measures Segment Site Rental Gross Margin. We define Segment Site Rental Gross Margin as segment site rental revenues less segment site rental cost of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense and prepaid lease purchase price adjustments recorded in consolidated site rental cost of operations. Segment Services and Other Gross Margin. We define Segment Services and Other Gross Margin as segment services and other revenues less segment services and other cost of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in consolidated services and other cost of operations. Segment Operating Profit. We define Segment Operating Profit as segment site rental gross margin plus segment services and other gross margin, and segment other operating (income) expense, less selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to the respective segment. All of these measurements of profit or loss are exclusive of depreciation, amortization and accretion, which are shown separately. Additionally, certain costs are shared across segments and are reflected in our segment measures through allocations that management believes to be reasonable. Other Calculations Discretionary capital expenditures. We define discretionary capital expenditures as those capital expenditures made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to enhance long-term stockholder value. They primarily consist of expansion or development of communications infrastructure (including capital expenditures related to (1) enhancing communications infrastructure in order to add new tenants for the first time or support subsequent tenant equipment augmentations or (2) modifying the structure of a communications infrastructure asset to accommodate additional tenants) and construction of new communications infrastructure. Discretionary capital expenditures also include purchases of land interests (which primarily relates to land assets under towers as we seek to manage our interests in the land beneath our towers), certain technology-related investments necessary to support and scale future customer demand for our communications infrastructure, and other capital projects. Sustaining capital expenditures. We define sustaining capital expenditures as those capital expenditures not otherwise categorized as either discretionary or integration capital expenditures, such as (1) maintenance capital expenditures on our communications infrastructure assets that enable our tenants' ongoing quiet enjoyment of the communications infrastructure and (2) ordinary corporate capital expenditures.

Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This news release contains forward-looking statements and information that are based on our management's current expectations as of the date of this news release. Statements that are not historical facts are hereby identified as forward-looking statements. In addition, words such as \"estimate,\" \"see,\" \"anticipate,\" \"project,\" \"plan,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"likely,\" \"predicted,\" \"positioned,\" \"continue,\" \"target,\" and any variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements include our full year 2021 Outlook and plans, projections, and estimates regarding (1) potential benefits, growth, returns, capabilities, opportunities and shareholder value which may be derived from our business, strategy, risk profile, assets, investments, acquisitions and dividends, (2) our business, strategy, strategic position, business model and capabilities and the strength thereof, (3) industry fundamentals and driving factors for improvements in such fundamentals, (4) our customers' investment, including investment cycles and the timing thereof, in network improvements (including 5G), the trends driving such investment and opportunities and demand for our assets created thereby, (5) our long-and short-term prospects and the trends, events and industry activities impacting our business, (6) opportunities we see to deliver value to our shareholders, (7) our dividends (including timing of payment thereof) and our long- and short-term dividend (including on a per share basis) growth rate, including its driving factors, and targets, (8) revenue growth in the Towers segment, (9) debt maturities, (10) strategic position of our portfolio of assets, (11) cash flows, including growth thereof, (12) leasing environment and the activity we see in our business, (13) tenant non-renewals, including the impact and timing thereof, (14) capital expenditures, including sustaining and discretionary capital expenditures, the timing thereof and any efficiencies that may result therefrom, and the discretionary capital budget and the funding (including capacity to fund) thereof, (15) straight-line adjustments, (16) revenues and growth thereof and benefits derived therefrom, (17) the recurrence of Nontypical Items, (18) net income (loss) (including on a per share basis and as adjusted for Nontypical Items), (19) Adjusted EBITDA (including as adjusted for Nontypical Items), including components thereof and growth thereof, (20) expenses, including interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, (21) FFO (including on a per share basis) and growth thereof, (22) AFFO (including on a per share basis and as adjusted for Nontypical Items) and its components and growth thereof and corresponding driving factors, (23) Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues and its components, including growth thereof and contributions therefrom, (24) our weighted-average common shares outstanding (including on a diluted basis) and growth thereof, (25) services contribution and labor related costs, (26) our growing number of customers, (27) benefits stemming from our recent tower leasing agreement with Verizon, (28) the utility of certain financial measures, including non-GAAP financial measures and (29) the strength of the U.S. market for communications infrastructure ownership. All future dividends are subject to declaration by our board of directors. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including prevailing market conditions and the following: Our business depends on the demand for our communications infrastructure, driven primarily by demand for data, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. Additionally, a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our tenants may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our communications infrastructure or services).A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of tenants, and the loss, consolidation or financial instability of any of such tenants may materially decrease revenues or reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and services.The expansion or development of our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities, may cause disruptions in our business, which may have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial results.Our Fiber segment has expanded rapidly, and the Fiber business model contains certain differences from our Towers business model, resulting in different operational risks. If we do not successfully operate our Fiber business model or identify or manage the related operational risks, such operations may produce results that are lower than anticipated.Failure to timely, efficiently and safely execute on our construction projects could adversely affect our business.Our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and the terms of our debt instruments limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests. In addition, if we fail to comply with our covenants, our debt could be accelerated.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. In the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations.Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.As a result of competition in our industry, we may find it more difficult to negotiate favorable rates on our new or renewing tenant contracts.New technologies may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues.If we fail to retain rights to our communications infrastructure, including the rights to land under our towers and the right-of-way and other agreements related to our small cells and fiber, our business may be adversely affected.Our services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand, which reduces the predictability of our results.The restatement of our previously issued financial statements, the errors that resulted in such restatement, the material weakness that was previously identified in our internal control over financial reporting and the determination that our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, could result in loss of investor confidence, shareholder litigation or governmental proceedings or investigations, any of which could cause the market value of our common stock or debt securities to decline or impact our ability to access the capital markets.New wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by tenants as rapidly or in the manner projected.If we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time, we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business.If radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our communications infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects, potential future claims could adversely affect our operations, costs or revenues.Certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws and operative agreements, and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.We may be vulnerable to security breaches or other unforeseen events that could adversely affect our operations, business, and reputation.Future dividend payments to our stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments, and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities. In such event, the then current economic, credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing, which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations.Remaining qualified to be taxed as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Failure to remain qualified as a REIT would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income, which would reduce our available cash.Complying with REIT requirements, including the 90% distribution requirement, may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities, including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives.REIT related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may prevent or restrict certain transfers of our capital stock.The impact of COVID-19 and related risks could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Should one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expected. More information about potential risk factors which could affect our results is included in our filings with the SEC. Our filings with the SEC are available through the SEC website at www.sec.gov or through our investor relations website at investor.crowncastle.com. We use our investor relations website to disclose information about us that may be deemed to be material.

Both the agreements established terms for leasing space on existing towers for C-band equipment. The addition of the C-band spectrum will enable Verizon to offer the differentiated 5G Ultra-Wideband mobility service to an additional 250 million customers offering the internet provider choice to 50 million additional customers, stated Verizon SVP Heidi Hemmer. Price action: VZ shares traded higher by 0.10% at $57.55 on the last check Monday.

Earnings came in at 34 cents per share, an increase of 25% yoy.On the insider front, Board of Directors member James Hay put down $433,750 for a purchase of 10,000 shares on January 29. This brings the insider sentiment here into positive territory.Truist analyst Mark Hughes, rated 5-stars by TipRanks, sees Brown & Brown as a solid choice for investors interesting in the insurance sector.\u201cThe company is generating solid organic revenue growth, margins should be steady-to-up this year, and M&A activity has been healthy, all of which should drive solid top- and bottom-line expansion in coming periods. We believe BRO shares remain a good way for investors to get exposure to the recovering economy and firming P&C pricing,\u201d Hughes opined. In line with his optimistic approach, Hughes rates BRO a Buy, and his $55 price target indicates confidence in ~25% growth for the next 12 months. (To watch Hughes\u2019 track record, click here)Is the rest of the Street in agreement? As it turns out, the analyst consensus is more of a mixed bag. Split almost right down in the middle, 4 Buy ratings and 5 Holds were assigned in the last three months, giving BRO Moderate Buy status. With a $51.44 average price target, the potential twelve-month gain comes in at 17%. (See BRO stock analysis on TipRanks)Crown Castle (CCI)The second insider pick we\u2019re looking at, Crown Castle, is a real estate investment trust with a twist. The company owns and manages communications infrastructure, specifically, the tower and transmitter locations so important to cellular networks. Crown Castle\u2019s property portfolio includes more than 40,000 towers, 70,000 small cell locations, and 80,000 miles worth of connecting fiber optic cables. The rollout of the new 5G wireless network has been a boon to Crown Castle\u2019s model in the past year.Crown Castle's revenues remained steady through 2020, ranging between $1.4 to $1.49 billion, with the third and fourth quarter results both at $1.49 billion. For Q4, that was an 11% yoy gain. For 2020 as a whole, CCI reported $5.3 billion, up 3.8% yoy.Crown Castle\u2019s position was sound enough that the company raised its dividend payment by more than 10% in December. The new payment, $1.33 per common share, gives an annual payment of $5.32 and a yield of 3.2%.Turning to the insider trades, we find that Kevin Stephens, one of the company\u2019s Directors, paid $328,300 for a bloc of 2,000 shares. Stephens now owns $671,000 worth of CCI; this recent purchase nearly doubled his total holding.5-star analyst Colby Synesael, from Cowen, takes a highly bullish stance on Crown Castle. He notes that CCI has \u201ca new agreement with Verizon in which the carrier has agreed to lease 15K small cells from Crown that will install over the next four years\u2026\" The analyst added, \"[We] estimate the avg. ARPU is $500/mo. (w/ a 1.5% escalator), suggesting an initial annualized value of ~$90MM. The deal represents the company\u2019s largest single small cell deal in its history\u2026 the deal raises Crown\u2019s small cell backlog to ~30K from previously ~20K.\u201dSynesael\u2019s confidence is clear from his Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on the stock. His $197 price target suggests a one-year upside of 21%. (To watch Synesael\u2019s track record, click here)Overall, Wall Street\u2019s analysts like what they see here. CCI's Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 8 recent reviews, breaking down to 7 Buys and a single Hold. CCI's average price target is $177.25, implying a 9% upside from the current share price of $177.25.

"Nasdaq", "summary": "5G is here. The new networks are online and expanding, and customers \u2013 individual consumers, institutional users, and industrial applications \u2013 are starting to take advantage of the new technology. The advantages of 5G are already well-known: faster connections, more efficient upload and download capability, lower latency, greater security. 5G tech is essential for developing the full potential of autonomous vehicles and IoT projects. How it will impact ordinary life remains to be seen.Some of Wall Street\u2019s top analysts have been taking the measure of the new network, and its probably effect on related companies \u2013 and their stocks. Using TipRanks database, we\u2019ve pulled up the latest data on three such stocks that the analysts have tapped for gains in the growing 5G environment. CommScope Holding (COMM)We will start with CommScope, a hardware provider for network infrastructure. The company produces antennas for building and tower installation, base stations, and outdoor wireless system power supplies. As a holding company, these CommScope products are produced and marketed by subsidiaries, to customers worldwide.The company announced last month a partnership with Nokia on a passive-active antenna platform, promising a faster 5G rollout for customers. And earlier this month, CommScope announced a contract with the city of Wyandotte, Michigan, for networking installation, including 5G, and giving the company access to over 25,000 potential customers.CommScope reported $2.17 billion in Q3 revenue, up 3% year-over-year. The Broadband segment showed 20% year-over-year growth, and the free cash flow hit $350 million. JPMorgan\u2019s 5-star analyst Samik Chatterjee elaborates on CommScope forward potential: \u201cOur constructive view on shares of CommScope is led by expectations for an improving outlook for the Outdoor Wireless Segment which stands positioned to benefit from the ramp in 5G densification efforts for wireless networks, in combination with continuing resilient spending from cable/broadband networks.\u201d\"We expect the pace of investments in the wireline network to continue, led by bandwidth requirements to support peak usage, in addition to tailwinds stemming from initiatives such as RDOF and reclamation of satellite spectrum for 5G,\" the analyst added.In line with these comments, Chatterjee rates the stock an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and his $18 price target suggests a 35% upside in the coming year. (To watch Chatterjee\u2019s track record, click here)Chatterjee is broadly in line with the rest of Wall Street, which has assigned COMM slightly more \"buy\" ratings than \"holds\" over the past three months -- and sees the stock growing about 19% over the next 12 months, to a target price of $15.80. (See COMM stock analysis on TipRanks)Crown Castle (CCI)The next stock on our list, Crown Castle, operates as a real estate investment trust, owning and managing cell network assets, including towers and transmitter locations. The company boasts over 40,000 towers, 70,000 operational small cells, and 80,000 miles of fiberoptic lines. Crown Castle\u2019s network is part of the shared infrastructure supporting the wireless communications system in the US.The expansion of 5G networks has been good to Crown Castle, and the company has seen growth and expansion.In November, Crown Castle signed an agreement with DISH, which is looking to expand its 5G footprint. The lease agreement gives DISH rental rights on up to 20,000 towers, and includes fiber transport.Quarterly revenues have held steady between $1.4 and $1.49 billion all year, with Q3, the most recent, coming at the latter value. The company saw site rental revenue gain 4% yoy. Customer rollouts to 5G, and consequent need for additional tower sites, underlies the sound financial results.The sound quarterly results allowed the company to increase its quarterly dividend by 11%. Common share holders now receive $1.33 per common share, annualizing to $5.32 and giving a yield of 3.4%.Deutsche Bank analyst Matthew Niknam sees the DISH deal as part of an overall positive picture for Crown Castle: \"CCI is poised to be the early beneficiary of multiple new industry catalysts in upcoming years, including DISH's 5G build and C-Band spectrum deployments.\"\"Specifically, we believe its agreement with DISH for up to 20k sites puts it in a premier position to be the tower partner of choice, at least early on. Our analysis indicates DISH could easily account for 10% of CCI's Tower site leasing revenue by 2027E, with the agreement (conservatively) adding $15/share in value for CCI. Second, with ~70% of CCI's sites located in the top 100 markets, we believe its portfolio over indexes to markets most likely to see initial C-Band builds,\" the analyst added. To this end, Niknam rates CCI a Buy along with a $180 price target. This figure implies a 17% upside from current levels. (To watch Niknam\u2019s track record, click here)So, that\u2019s Deutsche Bank's view, let\u2019s turn our attention now to rest of the Street: CCI's 3 Buys and 2 Holds coalesce into a Moderate Buy rating. Should the $170.25 average price target be met, about 11% upside could be in store. (See CCI stock analysis on TipRanks)Sierra Wireless (SWIR)Based in British Columbia, Canada, Sierra Wireless designs and manufactures wireless equipment for an international customer base. The company products include machine-to-machine and mobile computing devices for use on wireless networks, as well as modems, routers, and gateways for mobile broadband wireless. Sierra holds over 550 unique patents.Sierra\u2019s focus on machine-to-machine systems make its hardware especially valuable for IoT applications. The company offers 5G capable routers and broadcast solutions for IoT networks, as well as the first 5G enabled vehicle router on the market.Turning to the financials and the stock, we see the company moving in two directions at once. Quarterly revenues have been falling this year, and Q3 came in at just $113 million \u2013 far down from the $144 million reported in Q2. While the quarter was generally down, the automotive business did show a 3.6% yoy increase.The company\u2019s stock, however, has been on an upward trajectory, and with a 49% year-to-date gain has outperformed the S&P 500 index.Among the bulls is Colliers analyst Charles Anderson who calls SWIR a \"5G IoT play.\" Anderson rates the stock a Buy along with a $20 price target. This target indicates the extent of his confidence \u2013 it implies a 40% one-year upside. (To watch Anderson\u2019s track record, click here)Backing his stance, Anderson writes, \u201cWe like the combination here of management/Board upgrades (CEOs that led turnarounds at IDTI and LSCC recently joined the Board); business model transition toward higher margin recurring revenue; 5G product cycle exposure; and depressed valuation relative to both peers and historicals\u2026\"\"Sierra is in the process of transforming itself from a low margin supplier of cellular connectivity hardware to a higher margin supplier of full stack cellular IoT (hardware/software/service). This is both a better business model and a more compelling offering to customers,\" the analyst added.All in all, Sierra has an even split among the recent reviews, 2 Buys and 2 Holds, making the analyst consensus rating a Moderate Buy.

A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future.View more earnings on CCIMost often, an industry will prevail in a particular phase of a business cycle, than other industries.Crown Castle Intl Inc. has a better P/E ratio of 94.13 than the aggregate P/E ratio of 82.57 of the Equity Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) industry.

We have a long history of consistently delivering compelling growth through various market cycles and disruptions, highlighting the strength of our business model and the compelling value creation opportunity we believe our strategy provides to shareholders.  \"As we look ahead, we have increased our annualized common stock dividend by 11% to $5.32 per share. With the strong demand we see for our Towers and Fiber infrastructure as our customers deploy additional cell sites and spectrum in response to the rapid growth in mobile data traffic, we expect approximately 6% growth in Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenue across both our Towers and Fiber segments in 2021, supporting an expected acceleration in AFFO per share growth to approximately 10%. Our unique portfolio of assets positions us to benefit from what we expect will be a decade-long investment cycle as our customers deploy 5G, which we believe will start in earnest in 2021.  We believe our ability to offer towers, small cells and fiber solutions, which are all integral components of communications networks and are shared among multiple tenants, provides us the best opportunity to generate significant growth while delivering high returns for our shareholders. Based on the expected growth in data traffic and wireless carrier network investment, we believe\u00a0the U.S. represents the best market in the world for communications infrastructure ownership, and we are pursuing that compelling opportunity with our comprehensive offering.\"RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER  The table below sets forth select financial results for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2020 and September 30, 2019.(in millions, except per share amounts)Q3 2020Q3 2019Change% Change  \u00a0\u00a0(As Restated)(c)\u00a0\u00a0  Site rental revenues$1,339$1,287+$52+4%  Net income (loss)$163$242-$79-33%  Net income (loss) per share\u2014diluted(a)$0.38$0.51-$0.13-25%  Adjusted EBITDA(b)$883$853+$30+4%  AFFO(a)(b)$668$617+$51+8%  AFFO per share(a)(b)$1.56$1.47+$0.09+6%    (a) Attributable to CCIC common stockholders.

(c) See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for further information.HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE QUARTER  * Site rental revenues. Site rental revenues grew 4.0%, or $52 million, from third quarter 2019 to third quarter 2020, inclusive of approximately $70 million in Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues and a $18 million decrease in straight-lined revenues. The $70 million in Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues represents approximately 5.5% growth, comprised of approximately 9.1% growth from new leasing activity and contracted tenant escalations, net of approximately 3.6% from tenant non-renewals.  * Net income. Net income for the third quarter 2020 was $163 million compared to $242 million during the third quarter of 2019 and was impacted by the retirement of $2.4 billion of senior unsecured notes during July 2020, which resulted in a $95 million loss on the retirement of long-term obligations.  * Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $377 million, comprised of $20 million of sustaining capital expenditures and $357 million of discretionary capital expenditures. Discretionary capital expenditures during the quarter primarily included approximately $274 million attributable to Fiber and approximately $73 million attributable to Towers.  * Common stock dividend. During the quarter, Crown Castle paid common stock dividends of approximately $518 million in the aggregate, or $1.20 per common share, an increase of approximately 7% on a per share basis compared to the same period a year ago.  * Financing Activity. In July, Crown Castle utilized net proceeds from a June 2020 senior unsecured notes offering to retire an aggregate of $2.4 billion of senior unsecured notes. Also during the quarter, all outstanding shares of Crown Castle's 6.875% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into approximately 14.5 million shares of Crown Castle common stock. These conversions increased the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for 2020 by approximately 6 million shares and reduced the annual preferred stock dividends paid by approximately $28 million when compared to full year 2019.  \"We believe we can deliver on our long-term annual dividend growth target of 7% to 8% while at the same time making investments in our business that will support future growth,\" stated Dan Schlanger, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer. \"Looking to 2021, the portion of our small cell backlog we expect to put on air has a higher proportion of collocation nodes relative to recent years, reducing the capital intensity in that business. Due to this reduced capital intensity, combined with the completion of several large fiber expansion projects in 2020, we expect our discretionary capital expenditures to be approximately $400 million lower in 2021 when compared to 2019 while delivering AFFO per share growth above our long-term target. We anticipate the combination of lower capital expenditures and higher cash flow growth will allow us to fund our discretionary capital budget next year with free cash flow and incremental debt capacity, consistent with our Investment Grade credit profile.\"OUTLOOKThis Outlook section contains forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Information regarding potential risks which could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements herein is set forth below and in Crown Castle's filings with the SEC.

(b) See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Segment Measures and Other Calculations\" for further information and reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to net income (loss).  * The reduction to the 2020 Outlook primarily reflects an expected shift in the timing of Towers activity from the second half of 2020 to the first half of 2021. The change in the timing of Towers activity negatively impacts the expected Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues by approximately $20 million and services contribution from towers by approximately $50 million. In addition, straight-lined revenues from Towers for full year 2020 are expected to be approximately $20 million lower than previously expected, due to a combination of the timing of Towers activity as well as fewer lease extensions than previously forecasted.  * These changes are offset by approximately $10 million in lower expenses, approximately $30 million in lower interest expense and approximately $25 million in lower sustaining capital expenditures as compared to our prior 2020 Outlook.  * The chart below reconciles the components of expected growth in site rental revenues from 2020 to 2021 of $215 million to $260 million, inclusive of expected Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues during 2021 of $295 million to $335 million, or approximately 6%.  Chart 1:\u00a0https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/a44e7d91-5f00-438d-adfb-18a47577b833    * New leasing activity is expected to contribute $375 million to $405 million to 2021 Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues, consisting of new leasing activity from towers of $150 million to $160 million (compared to approximately $150 million expected in full year 2020), small cells of $65 million to $75 million (compared to approximately $70 million expected in full year 2020), and fiber solutions of $160 million to $170 million (compared to approximately $160 million expected in full year 2020).    * In addition, discretionary capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $1.5 billion in 2021, which compares to an expected $1.6 billion in 2020 and $1.9 billion in 2019. Prepaid rent additions are expected to be approximately $550 million in 2021, which compares to approximately $450 million expected in full year 2020 and approximately $650 million in 2019.  * The expected decrease in discretionary capital expenditures of approximately $400 million from 2019 to 2021 primarily reflects an expected decrease in small cell capital expenditures supporting similar revenue growth due to an expected increase in collocation activity, and the expected completion of several large fiber expansion projects by the end of 2020 that resulted from prior acquisitions.  * The chart below reconciles the components of expected growth in AFFO from 2020 to 2021 of $300 million to $345 million.  Chart 2:\u00a0https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/90382e94-ad47-47ab-8292-81511796c74a    * The expected contribution to 2021 AFFO growth of $60 million to $90 million from Other items is primarily tied to the conversions of preferred stock that occurred during the third quarter, which will reduce annual preferred stock dividends paid by approximately $85 million when compared to full year 2020.    * The increase in services contribution is a result of the expected increase in tower activity in 2021.  * The expected increase in expenses primarily reflects the combination of typical escalations and cost of living increases on the existing base of expenses, and incremental direct costs associated with Fiber revenue growth.  * Additional information is available in Crown Castle's quarterly Supplemental Information Package posted in the Investors section of our website.DIVIDEND INCREASE ANNOUNCEMENT  Crown Castle's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.33 per common share, representing an increase of approximately 11% over the previous quarterly dividend of $1.20 per share.

This nationwide portfolio of communications infrastructure connects cities and communities to essential data, technology and wireless service - bringing information, ideas and innovations to the people and businesses that need them. For more information on Crown Castle, please visit www.crowncastle.com.Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Segment Measures and Other Calculations  This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Funds from Operations (\"AFFO\"), including per share amounts, Funds from Operations (\"FFO\"), including per share amounts, and Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\")).Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the communications infrastructure sector or other real estate investment trusts (\"REITs\"). Our definition of FFO is consistent with guidelines from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts with the exception of the impact of income taxes in periods prior to our REIT conversion in 2014.In addition to the non-GAAP financial measures used herein, we also provide Segment Site Rental Gross Margin, Segment Services and Other Gross Margin and Segment Operating Profit, which are key measures used by management to evaluate our operating segments. These segment measures are provided pursuant to GAAP requirements related to segment reporting. In addition, we provide the components of certain GAAP measures, such as capital expenditures.Our non-GAAP financial measures are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our business. Among other things, management believes that:  * Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of the communications infrastructure sector and other REITs to measure financial performance without regard to items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.  * AFFO, including per share amounts, is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that AFFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as it includes (1) the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt and dividends on our preferred stock (in periods where applicable)) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures, and excludes the impact of our (a) asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) and (b) certain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed escalations and rent free periods. GAAP requires rental revenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be recognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment terms call for fixed escalations, or rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the contract. Management notes that Crown Castle uses AFFO only as a performance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary investment.  * FFO, including per share amounts, is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that FFO may be used by investors or other interested parties as a basis to compare our financial performance with that of other REITs. FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate financial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion). FFO is not a key performance indicator used by Crown Castle. FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operations.  * Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues is useful to investors or other interested parties in understanding the components of the year-over-year changes in our site rental revenues computed in accordance with GAAP. Management uses the Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues to assess year-over-year growth rates for our rental activities, to evaluate current performance, to capture trends in rental rates, new leasing activities and tenant non-renewals in our core business, as well to forecast future results. Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues is not meant as an alternative measure of revenue and should be considered only as a supplement in understanding and assessing the performance of our site rental revenues computed in accordance with GAAP.We define our non-GAAP financial measures, segment measures and other calculations as follows:Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresAdjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, (gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations, net (gain) loss on interest rate swaps, (gains) losses on foreign currency swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest income, other (income) expense, (benefit) provision for income taxes, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, (income) loss from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense.Adjusted Funds from Operations. We define Adjusted Funds from Operations as FFO before straight-lined revenue, straight-lined expense, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash portion of tax provision, non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of non-cash interest expense, other (income) expense, (gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations, net (gain) loss on interest rate swaps, (gains) losses on foreign currency swaps, acquisition and integration costs, and adjustments for noncontrolling interests, and less sustaining capital expenditures.AFFO per share. We define AFFO per share as AFFO divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.Funds from Operations. We define Funds from Operations as net income plus real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset write-down charges, less noncontrolling interest and cash paid for preferred stock dividends (in periods where applicable), and is a measure of funds from operations attributable to CCIC common stockholders.FFO per share. We define FFO per share as FFO divided by the diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues. We define the Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues as the sum of the change in GAAP site rental revenues related to (1) new leasing activity, including revenues from the construction of small cells and the impact of prepaid rent, (2) escalators and less (3) non-renewals of tenant contracts.Segment MeasuresSegment Site Rental Gross Margin. We define Segment Site Rental Gross Margin as segment site rental revenues less segment site rental cost of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense and prepaid lease purchase price adjustments recorded in consolidated site rental cost of operations.Segment Services and Other Gross Margin. We define Segment Services and Other Gross Margin as segment services and other revenues less segment services and other cost of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in consolidated services and other cost of operations.Segment Operating Profit. We define Segment Operating Profit as segment site rental gross margin plus segment services and other gross margin, less selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to the respective segment.All of these measurements of profit or loss are exclusive of depreciation, amortization and accretion, which are shown separately. Additionally, certain costs are shared across segments and are reflected in our segment measures through allocations that management believes to be reasonable.Other CalculationsDiscretionary capital expenditures. We define discretionary capital expenditures as those capital expenditures made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to enhance long-term stockholder value. They primarily consist of expansion or development of communications infrastructure (including capital expenditures related to (1) enhancing communications infrastructure in order to add new tenants for the first time or support subsequent tenant equipment augmentations or (2) modifying the structure of a communications infrastructure asset to accommodate additional tenants) and construction of new communications infrastructure. Discretionary capital expenditures also include purchases of land interests (which primarily relates to land assets under towers as we seek to manage our interests in the land beneath our towers), certain technology-related investments necessary to support and scale future customer demand for our communications infrastructure, and other capital projects.Integration capital expenditures.

Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis news release contains forward-looking statements and information that are based on our management's current expectations as of the date of this news release. Statements that are not historical facts are hereby identified as forward-looking statements. In addition, words such as \"estimate,\" \"see,\" \"anticipate,\" \"project,\" \"plan,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"likely,\" \"predicted,\" \"positioned,\" \"continue,\" \"target,\" and any variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements include our full year 2020 and 2021 Outlook and plans, projections, and estimates regarding (1) potential benefits, growth, returns, capabilities, opportunities and shareholder value which may be derived from our business, assets, investments, acquisitions and dividends, (2) our business, strategy, strategic position, business model and capabilities and the strength thereof, (3) industry fundamentals and driving factors for improvements in such fundamentals, (4) our customers' investment, including investment cycles and the timing thereof, in network improvements (including 5G), the trends driving such improvements and opportunities and demand for our assets created thereby, (5) our long-and short-term prospects and the trends, events and industry activities impacting our business, (6) opportunities we see to deliver value to our shareholders, (7) our dividends (including timing of payment thereof) and our dividend (including on a per share basis) growth rate, including its driving factors, and targets, (8) expected completion of fiber expansion projects, (9) small cell backlog, (10)\u00a0debt maturities, (11) strategic position of our portfolio of assets, (12)\u00a0cash flows, including growth thereof, (13)\u00a0leasing activity and the timing thereof, (14) tenant non-renewals, including the impact and timing thereof, (15) capital expenditures, including sustaining and discretionary capital expenditures, the timing thereof and any efficiencies that may result therefrom, and the discretionary capital budget and the funding thereof, (16) straight-line adjustments, (17) revenues and growth thereof and benefits derived therefrom, (18)\u00a0net income (loss) (including on a per share basis), (19)\u00a0Adjusted EBITDA, including components thereof and growth thereof, (20)\u00a0expenses, including interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, (21) FFO (including on a per share basis) and growth thereof, (22) AFFO (including on a per share basis) and its components and growth thereof and corresponding driving factors, (23) Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues and its components, including growth thereof and contributions therefrom, (24) our weighted-average common shares outstanding (including on a diluted basis) and growth thereof, (25)\u00a0services contribution, (26) pre-paid rent, (27) appointment of directors, including the effective date thereof, and (28)\u00a0the utility of certain financial measures, including non-GAAP financial measures. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including prevailing market conditions and the following:  * Our business depends on the demand for our communications infrastructure, driven primarily by demand for data, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. Additionally, a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our tenants may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our communications infrastructure or services).  * A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of tenants, and the loss, consolidation or financial instability of any of such tenants may materially decrease revenues or reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and services.  * The expansion or development of our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities, may cause disruptions in our business, which may have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial results.  * Our Fiber segment has expanded rapidly, and the Fiber business model contains certain differences from our Towers business model, resulting in different operational risks. If we do not successfully operate our Fiber business model or identify or manage the related operational risks, such operations may produce results that are lower than anticipated.  * Failure to timely and efficiently execute on our construction projects could adversely affect our business.  * Our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and the terms of our debt instruments limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests. In addition, if we fail to comply with our covenants, our debt could be accelerated.  * We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. In the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations.  * Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  * As a result of competition in our industry, we may find it more difficult to negotiate favorable rates on our new or renewing tenant contracts.  * New technologies may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues.  * If we fail to retain rights to our communications infrastructure, including the land interests under our towers and the right-of-way and other agreements related to our small cells and fiber, our business may be adversely affected.  * Our services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand, which reduces the predictability of our results.  * The restatement of our previously issued financial statements, the errors that resulted in such restatement, the material weakness that was identified in our internal control over financial reporting and the determination that our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, could result in loss of investor confidence, shareholder litigation or governmental proceedings or investigations, any of which could cause the market value of our common stock or debt securities to decline or impact our ability to access the capital markets.  * New wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by tenants as rapidly or in the manner projected.  * If we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time, we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business.  * If radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our communications infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects, potential future claims could adversely affect our operations, costs or revenues.  * Certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws and operative agreements, and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.  * We may be vulnerable to security breaches or other unforeseen events that could adversely affect our operations, business, and reputation.  * Future dividend payments to our stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments, and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities. In such event, the then current economic, credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing, which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations.  * Remaining qualified to be taxed as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Failure to remain qualified as a REIT would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income, which would reduce our available cash.  * Complying with REIT requirements, including the 90% distribution requirement, may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities, including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives.  * REIT related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may prevent or restrict certain transfers of our capital stock.  * The impact of COVID-19 and related risks could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.   Should one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expected. More information about potential risk factors which could affect our results is included in our filings with the SEC. Our filings with the SEC are available through the SEC website at www.sec.gov or through our investor relations website at investor.crowncastle.com. We use our investor relations website to disclose information about us that may be deemed to be material.

Although the full rebound in overall industry activity on towers is taking a bit more time to materialize than we previously expected, we remain on track to generate at least 7% growth in AFFO per share this year. Looking beyond this year, I am excited about what will likely be another decade-long investment cycle for our customers with the deployment of 5G, and see the potential for our AFFO per share growth to improve next year.\"We believe our ability to offer towers, small cells and fiber solutions, which are all integral components of communications networks and are shared among multiple tenants, provides us the best opportunity to generate significant growth while delivering high returns for our shareholders. We believe that the U.S. represents the best market in the world for communications infrastructure ownership, and we are pursuing that compelling opportunity with our comprehensive offering. As we look forward, I am excited about the opportunity we see for Crown Castle to deliver long-term value to our shareholders while delivering dividend per share growth of 7% to 8% per year. Over the past several weeks, we have had the opportunity to engage with many of our shareholders. We have appreciated the thoughtful exchange of ideas during those discussions as well as the feedback they have given us. During these conversations, we heard two consistent points of investor feedback: they want more visibility into how our strategy and business are performing and they would like us to make certain improvements to our corporate governance practices. To address this feedback, we will discuss some increased disclosure around our small cell and fiber strategy during our earnings call tomorrow and, as we disclosed in a separate press release today, we are making changes to our corporate governance.\"RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER  The table below sets forth select financial results for the quarter ended June\u00a030, 2020 and June 30, 2019.(in millions, except per share amounts)Q2 2020Q2 2019Change% Change  \u00a0\u00a0(As Restated)(c)\u00a0\u00a0  Site rental revenues$1,319$1,263+$56+4%  Net income (loss)$200$216-$16-7%  Net income (loss) per share\u2014diluted(a)$0.41$0.45-$0.04-9%  Adjusted EBITDA(b)$831$827+$4\u2014%  AFFO(a)(b)$609$589+$20+3%  AFFO per share(a)(b)$1.45$1.41+$0.04+3%                (a) Attributable to CCIC common stockholders.

Site rental revenues grew approximately 4.4%, or $56 million, from second quarter 2019 to second quarter 2020, inclusive of approximately $69 million in Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues and a $13 million decrease in straight-lined revenues. The $69 million in Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues represents approximately 5.6% growth, comprised of approximately 9.4% growth from new leasing activity and contracted tenant escalations, net of approximately 3.8% from tenant non-renewals.  * Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $414 million, comprised of $24 million of sustaining capital expenditures and $390 million of discretionary capital expenditures. Discretionary capital expenditures included approximately $295 million attributable to Fiber, approximately $88 million attributable to Towers, and approximately $7 million attributable to Other.  * Common stock dividend. During the quarter, Crown Castle paid common stock dividends of approximately $500 million in the aggregate, or $1.20 per common share, an increase of approximately 7% on a per share basis compared to the same period a year ago.  * Financing Activity. In April, Crown Castle issued $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, with a combination of 10-year and 30-year maturities, resulting in a weighted average maturity and coupon of 18 years and approximately 3.6%, respectively. Net proceeds from the offering were used to repay outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility.\u00a0 In June, Crown Castle issued $2.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, with a combination of 5-year, 10-year and 30-year maturities, resulting in a weighted average maturity and coupon of 16 years and approximately 2.4%, respectively. In July, net proceeds from the offering were used to retire $2.4 billion of senior unsecured notes in the aggregate, resulting in a $95 million loss on the retirement of debt. After giving effect to the refinancing of the outstanding senior unsecured notes, Crown Castle had approximately $18.9 billion of total debt outstanding.\"We are excited about the significant network investments our customers are pursuing as they deploy 5G, and how well we are positioned with our comprehensive infrastructure offering across towers and fiber to meet our customers\u2019 needs and create significant value for our shareholders,\" stated Dan Schlanger, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer. \"By opportunistically accessing the investment grade bond market twice in recent months, we further strengthened our balance sheet by extending the maturity of our debt and reducing our cost of capital. We believe our liquidity position is strong with nearly $5 billion of undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility and no meaningful debt maturities until 2022, providing us with confidence that we are well positioned to navigate the current environment while investing in assets that we believe will add to long-term growth in dividends per share.\"OUTLOOKThis Outlook section contains forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially.

For more information on Crown Castle, please visit www.crowncastle.com.\u00a0  Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Segment Measures and Other CalculationsThis press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Funds from Operations (\"AFFO\"), including per share amounts, Funds from Operations (\"FFO\"), including per share amounts, and Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\")).Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the communications infrastructure sector or other real estate investment trusts (\"REITs\"). Our definition of FFO is consistent with guidelines from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts with the exception of the impact of income taxes in periods prior to our REIT conversion in 2014.In addition to the non-GAAP financial measures used herein, we also provide Segment Site Rental Gross Margin, Segment Services and Other Gross Margin and Segment Operating Profit, which are key measures used by management to evaluate our operating segments. These segment measures are provided pursuant to GAAP requirements related to segment reporting. In addition, we provide the components of certain GAAP measures, such as capital expenditures.Our non-GAAP financial measures are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our business. Among other things, management believes that:  * Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of the communications infrastructure sector and other REITs to measure financial performance without regard to items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.      * AFFO, including per share amounts, is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that AFFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as it includes (1) the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt and dividends on our preferred stock) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures, and excludes the impact of our (a) asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) and (b) certain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed escalations and rent free periods. GAAP requires rental revenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be recognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment terms call for fixed escalations, or rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the contract. Management notes that Crown Castle uses AFFO only as a performance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary investment.      * FFO, including per share amounts, is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that FFO may be used by investors or other interested parties as a basis to compare our financial performance with that of other REITs. FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate financial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion). FFO is not a key performance indicator used by Crown Castle. FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operations.      * Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues is useful to investors or other interested parties in understanding the components of the year-over-year changes in our site rental revenues computed in accordance with GAAP. Management uses the Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues to assess year-over-year growth rates for our rental activities, to evaluate current performance, to capture trends in rental rates, new leasing activities and tenant non-renewals in our core business, as well to forecast future results. Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues is not meant as an alternative measure of revenue and should be considered only as a supplement in understanding and assessing the performance of our site rental revenues computed in accordance with GAAP.We define our non-GAAP financial measures, segment measures and other calculations as follows:Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresAdjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, (gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations, net (gain) loss on interest rate swaps, (gains) losses on foreign currency swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest income, other (income) expense, (benefit) provision for income taxes, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, (income) loss from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense.Adjusted Funds from Operations. We define Adjusted Funds from Operations as FFO before straight-lined revenue, straight-lined expense, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash portion of tax provision, non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of non-cash interest expense, other (income) expense, (gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations, net (gain) loss on interest rate swaps, (gains) losses on foreign currency swaps, acquisition and integration costs, and adjustments for noncontrolling interests, and less sustaining capital expenditures.AFFO per share. We define AFFO per share as AFFO divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.Funds from Operations. We define Funds from Operations as net income plus real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset write-down charges, less noncontrolling interest and cash paid for preferred stock dividends, and is a measure of funds from operations attributable to CCIC common stockholders.FFO per share. We define FFO per share as FFO divided by the diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues. We define the Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues as the sum of the change in GAAP site rental revenues related to (1) new leasing activity, including revenues from the construction of small cells and the impact of prepaid rent, (2) escalators and less (3) non-renewals of tenant contracts.Segment MeasuresSegment Site Rental Gross Margin. We define Segment Site Rental Gross Margin as segment site rental revenues less segment site rental cost of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense and prepaid lease purchase price adjustments recorded in consolidated site rental cost of operations.Segment Services and Other Gross Margin. We define Segment Services and Other Gross Margin as segment services and other revenues less segment services and other cost of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in consolidated services and other cost of operations.Segment Operating Profit. We define Segment Operating Profit as segment site rental gross margin plus segment services and other gross margin, less selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to the respective segment.All of these measurements of profit or loss are exclusive of depreciation, amortization and accretion, which are shown separately. Additionally, certain costs are shared across segments and are reflected in our segment measures through allocations that management believes to be reasonable.Other CalculationsDiscretionary capital expenditures. We define discretionary capital expenditures as those capital expenditures made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to enhance long-term stockholder value. They primarily consist of expansion or development of communications infrastructure (including capital expenditures related to (1) enhancing communications infrastructure in order to add new tenants for the first time or support subsequent tenant equipment augmentations or (2) modifying the structure of a communications infrastructure asset to accommodate additional tenants) and construction of new communications infrastructure. Discretionary capital expenditures also include purchases of land interests (which primarily relates to land assets under towers as we seek to manage our interests in the land beneath our towers), certain technology-related investments necessary to support and scale future customer demand for our communications infrastructure, and other capital projects.Integration capital expenditures. We define integration capital expenditures as those capital expenditures made as a result of integrating acquired companies into our business.Sustaining capital expenditures. We define sustaining capital expenditures as those capital expenditures not otherwise categorized as either discretionary or integration capital expenditures, such as (1) maintenance capital expenditures on our communications infrastructure assets that enable our tenants' ongoing quiet enjoyment of the communications infrastructure and (2) ordinary corporate capital expenditures.The tables set forth on the following pages reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures used herein to comparable GAAP financial measures. The components in these tables may not sum to the total due to rounding.Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Segment Measures and Other Calculations to Comparable GAAP Financial Measures:Reconciliation of Historical Adjusted EBITDA:\u00a0For the Three Months Ended\u00a0For the Six Months Ended\u00a0For the Twelve   Months Ended  \u00a0June\u00a030, 2020\u00a0June 30, 2019\u00a0June 30, 2020\u00a0June 30, 2019\u00a0December 31,  2019  (in millions)\u00a0\u00a0(As Restated)(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(As Restated)(d)\u00a0\u00a0  Net income (loss)$200\u00a0\u00a0$216\u00a0\u00a0$386\u00a0\u00a0$409\u00a0\u00a0$860\u00a0  Adjustments to increase (decrease) net income (loss):\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Asset write-down charges3\u00a0\u00a06\u00a0\u00a07\u00a0\u00a012\u00a0\u00a019\u00a0  Acquisition and integration costs2\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a07\u00a0\u00a06\u00a0\u00a013\u00a0  Depreciation, amortization and accretion402\u00a0\u00a0393\u00a0\u00a0801\u00a0\u00a0787\u00a0\u00a01,572\u00a0  Amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments4\u00a0\u00a05\u00a0\u00a09\u00a0\u00a010\u00a0\u00a020\u00a0  Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs(a)178\u00a0\u00a0169\u00a0\u00a0353\u00a0\u00a0337\u00a0\u00a0683\u00a0  (Gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations\u2014\u00a0\u00a01\u00a0\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0  Interest income(1)\u00a0(1)\u00a0(2)\u00a0(3)\u00a0(6)  Other (income) expense\u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u00a01\u00a0\u00a0(1)  (Benefit) provision for income taxes6\u00a0\u00a04\u00a0\u00a011\u00a0\u00a010\u00a0\u00a021\u00a0  Stock-based compensation expense37\u00a0\u00a032\u00a0\u00a073\u00a0\u00a061\u00a0\u00a0116\u00a0  Adjusted EBITDA(b)(c)$831\u00a0\u00a0$827\u00a0\u00a0$1,645\u00a0\u00a0$1,632\u00a0\u00a0$3,299\u00a0    (a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 See the reconciliation of \"components of historical interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs\" herein for a discussion of non-cash interest expense.

Statements that are not historical facts are hereby identified as forward-looking statements. In addition, words such as \"estimate,\" \"see,\" \"anticipate,\" \"project,\" \"plan,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"likely,\" \"predicted,\" \"positioned,\" \"continue,\" \"target,\" and any variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements include our Outlook and plans, projections, and estimates regarding (1) potential benefits, growth, returns, opportunities and tenant and shareholder value which may be derived from our business, assets, investments, acquisitions and dividends, (2) our business, strategy, strategic position, business model and capabilities and the strength thereof, (3) industry fundamentals and driving factors for improvements in such fundamentals, (4) our customers' investment, including investment cycles, in network improvements (including 5G), the trends driving such improvements and opportunities created thereby, (5) impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, (6) our long-and short-term prospects and the trends, events and industry activities impacting our business, (7) opportunities we see to deliver value to our shareholders, (8) our dividends and our dividend (including on a per share basis) growth rate, including its driving factors, and targets, (9)\u00a0debt maturities, (10) strategic position of our portfolio of assets, (11)\u00a0assumed conversion of preferred stock and the impact therefrom, (12) cash flows, including growth thereof, (13)\u00a0leasing activity, (14) tenant non-renewals, including the impact and timing thereof, (15) capital expenditures, including sustaining and discretionary capital expenditures, and the timing thereof, (16) straight-line adjustments, (17) revenues and growth thereof and benefits derived therefrom, (18)\u00a0net income (loss) (including on a per share basis), (19)\u00a0Adjusted EBITDA, including the impact of the timing of certain components thereof and growth thereof, (20)\u00a0expenses, including interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, (21) FFO (including on a per share basis) and growth thereof, (22) AFFO (including on a per share basis) and growth thereof and corresponding driving factors, (23) Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues and its components, including contributions therefrom, (24) our weighted-average common shares outstanding (including on a diluted basis) and growth thereof, (25)\u00a0services contribution, and (26)\u00a0the utility of certain financial measures, including non-GAAP financial measures. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions prevailing market conditions and the following:  * Our business depends on the demand for our communications infrastructure, driven primarily by demand for data, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. Additionally, a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our tenants may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our communications infrastructure or services).  * A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of tenants, and the loss, consolidation or financial instability of any of such tenants may materially decrease revenues or reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and services.  * The expansion or development of our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities, may cause disruptions in our business, which may have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial results.  * Our Fiber segment has expanded rapidly, and the Fiber business model contains certain differences from our Towers business model, resulting in different operational risks. If we do not successfully operate our Fiber business model or identify or manage the related operational risks, such operations may produce results that are lower than anticipated.  * Failure to timely and efficiently execute on our construction projects could adversely affect our business.  * Our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and the terms of our debt instruments and our 6.875% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests. In addition, if we fail to comply with our covenants, our debt could be accelerated.  * We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. In the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations.  * Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  * As a result of competition in our industry, we may find it more difficult to negotiate favorable rates on our new or renewing tenant contracts.  * New technologies may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues.  * If we fail to retain rights to our communications infrastructure, including the land interests under our towers and the right-of-way and other agreements related to our small cells and fiber, our business may be adversely affected.  * Our services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand, which reduces the predictability of our results.  * The restatement of our previously issued financial statements, the errors that resulted in such restatement, the material weakness that was identified in our internal control over financial reporting and the determination that our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, could result in loss of investor confidence, shareholder litigation or governmental proceedings or investigations, any of which could cause the market value of our common stock or debt securities to decline or impact our ability to access the capital markets.  * New wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by tenants as rapidly or in the manner projected.  * If we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time, we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business.  * If radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our communications infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects, potential future claims could adversely affect our operations, costs or revenues.  * Certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws and operative agreements, and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.  * We may be vulnerable to security breaches or other unforeseen events that could adversely affect our operations, business, and reputation.  * Future dividend payments to our stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments, and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities. In such event, the then current economic, credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing, which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations.  * Remaining qualified to be taxed as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Failure to remain qualified as a REIT would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income, which would reduce our available cash.  * If we fail to pay scheduled dividends on our 6.875% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (prior to or in connection with the automatic conversion in August 2020), in cash, common stock, or any combination of cash and common stock, we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock, which may jeopardize our status as a REIT.  * Complying with REIT requirements, including the 90% distribution requirement, may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities, including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives.  * REIT related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may prevent or restrict certain transfers of our capital stock.  * The impact of COVID-19 and related risks could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Should one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expected. More information about potential risk factors which could affect our results is included in our filings with the SEC. Our filings with the SEC are available through the SEC website at www.sec.gov or through our investor relations website at investor.crowncastle.com. We use our investor relations website to disclose information about us that may be deemed to be material.
