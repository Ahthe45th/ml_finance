Digital migration trends, already under way before the Covid-19 pandemic hit, have accelerated, he said.Including debt, Global Compute will have a roughly $1.5 billion war chest to do deals in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. As future opportunities arise, Goldman and its fund investors may contribute additional capital toward the venture, Lebovitz said.Data-center transaction valuations have risen in recent years as the sector won favor with institutional investors in part because of expected ongoing growth. Lebovitz said Goldman Sachs has confidence in Global Compute\u2019s operating expertise in various areas. Peterson, Global Compute\u2019s chief executive officer, oversaw some $17 billion in deal volume across both organic development and mergers and acquisitions during his tenure at Digital Realty.\u201cThere\u2019s so much capital chasing deals, but based on the breadth of our track record, we believe we can find, evaluate and underwrite transactions as well as serve the critical needs of our customers,\u201d Peterson said in an interview.Peterson and Global Compute Chief Operating Officer Chris Kenney were longtime executives at real estate investment trust Digital Realty. Another Digital Realty veteran, Stephen Taylor, is Global Compute\u2019s head of Europe.Global Compute separately agreed to acquire ATM SA, a Polish data center and communications infrastructure business, from a group led by MCI and Mezzanine Management. Both Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. have announced plans to invest heavily in Poland.Following the Global Compute investment, Goldman\u2019s third infrastructure fund -- at $2.5 billion - is now more than 70% deployed. The firm is preparing to raise a fourth fund, likely dubbed West Street Global Infrastructure Partners IV LP, early next year, according to people with knowledge of the matter. A Goldman spokeswoman declined to comment on fundraising plans.Global Compute isn\u2019t Goldman\u2019s first foray into data centers.
