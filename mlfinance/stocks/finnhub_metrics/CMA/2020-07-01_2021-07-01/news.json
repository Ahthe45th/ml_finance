Meanwhile, net reserve release further cushioned its bottom line.Comerica\u2019s (CMA) earnings of $1.49 per share beat the Street's estimates of $1.19 per share but declined 19.5% year-over-year. However, earnings grew 3% sequentially, driven by \u201crevenue growth and strong credit quality,\u201d according to the company\u2019s CEO Curt C. Farmer.The bank\u2019s revenue (including net interest income and noninterest income) of $734 million declined by about 9% year-over-year but exceeded analysts' estimates of $704 million. On a quarter-over-quarter basis revenue grew 3.4%. Net interest income and noninterest income declined 13.8% and 0.4%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis, but improved sequentially by 2.4% and 5.2%, respectively. As of Dec. 31, 2020, loans increased 1.8% to $51.4 billion, while deposits rose 22.8% to $70.2 billion.As for 1Q, Comerica expects a decline in average loans. However, the company projects its average deposits to remain strong compared to 4Q levels. It forecasts net interest income and noninterest income to decline from the preceding quarter. (See CMA stock analysis on TipRanks)Following the results, Raymond James analyst Michael Rose raised the stock\u2019s price target to $72 (12.7% upside potential) from $71 and maintained a Buy rating. The analyst said, \u201cWhile a net reserve release fueled the upside, revenue (both net interest income and fee revenue) exceeded our forecast, which was partially offset by higher expenses.\u201dUnlike Rose, the rest of the Street is sidelined on the stock with the analyst consensus of a Hold based on 4 Holds, 5 Buys and 3 Sells. The average analyst\u00a0price target of $57.67 implies downside potential of about 9.8% to current levels.

And even though dividend stocks tend to return less on share appreciation, there are still plenty out there that are showing high upside potential.Finding the right dividend stock, however, is the real trick. Top analysts from investment bank RBC have been focusing their gaze on some likely candidates for income investors\u2019 interest.

These are stocks that the Street is leery of \u2013 they feature Hold ratings \u2013 but RBC sees a better promise from each of them. Comerica, Inc. (CMA)We\u2019ll start in the banking sector. RBC\u2019s 5-star analyst Jon Arfstrom likes Comerica, the holding company behind Comerica Bank \u2013 and a number of recognizable landmarks, including the Detroit Tigers\u2019 Comerica Park. The company saw $3.82 billion in revenues last year, netting $1.2 billion income.So, CMA had a sound position entering 2020. Even so, the first half was hard on the company. Business declined sharply at consumer banking locations, and the first quarter saw EPS shift from $1.85 profit to a 46-cent loss. The bank began to recover in Q2 when state and local authorities began lifting restrictions. Q2 earnings were positive, at $113 million, or 80 cents per share.The positive Q2 earnings vindicate CMA\u2019s decision in March to raise the quarterly dividend from 67 cents to 68 cents per share. The current payment annualizes to $2.72 and gives a yield of 7.4%. This compares favorably to the average yield among peer companies in the financial sector, of 2.6%. And even after the company\u2019s share depreciation of 1H20, the payout ratio is only 12%, indicating that this dividend is safe at current income levelsArfstrom\u2019s review of the stock points out the generally conservative stance of company management toward combatting the coronavirus economic downturn. Common sense business fundamentals have served Comerica well. \u201c[We] believe Comerica will be capable of generating solid returns\u2026 a strong capital position and attractive commercial lending franchise positions the company well... we are encouraged by management's aggressive upfront actions including the significant reserve build in 1H20. We believe that by taking these actions now, the company should be much better prepared to weather any economic storm over the coming quarters,\u201d Artstrom noted. In line with his outlook, Arfstrom rates CMA a Buy, and gives the stock a $46 price target. This implies a one-year upside potential of 23%. (To watch Arfstrom\u2019s track record, click here)Overall, CMA has a Hold consensus rating from Wall Street\u2019s analysts, based on 4 Buys, 6 Holds, and 1 Sell. The rating is still feeling the effects of analyst caution, and of recessionary pressures that have not fully abated. The stock is selling for $37.35, and the $41.44 average price target suggests it has room for 11% growth. (See Comerica stock analysis on TipRanks)Genesis Energy, LP (GEL)Next on our list, Genesis Energy LP, is a midstream player in the Gulf Coast crude oil and natural gas industry. Midstreamers like Genesis provide the services that move oil and gas from the wellheads to the customers \u2013 transportation, processing, storage, and terminalling. GEL\u2019s earnings have been depressed since 2H19, but 1H20 saw a 67% sequential gain in EPS despite the coronavirus pandemic. Net income in the quarter was $24.9 million, up from $16 million in the year-ago quarter. The company will report Q2 earnings on August 5.Gaining ground during the downturn was a feather in the company\u2019s cap, but it did not change the fundamental reality of the situation: economic times are not good. In response, Genesis cut back its dividend payment. The move came in Q1, and reduced the payment from 55 to 15 cents per share. While a severe cut, the move has some positive aspects. First, it keeps the income stream for investors. Second, it brought the payment into line with income, making it sustainable. And finally, even at reduced levels, it gives shareholders a yield of 8.85%, strong by any standard.Covering the stock for RBC is TJ Schultz, rated 5-stars by TipRanks. He points out that Genesis is shoring up liquidity and has a clear path forward with new midstream projects. He lays out the case clearly: \u201c[We] think GEL pays down debt following the recent distribution cut\u2026 Large scale, sanctioned projects projected to flow into GEL system look to remain on schedule, and we still expect cash flow growth here through 2022.\u201d\"We think GEL is positioned to weather the current downturn and should be FCF positive for the next several years.

(CMA)\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ll start in the banking sector. RBC\u2019s 5-star analyst Jon Arfstrom likes Comerica, the holding company behind Comerica Bank \u2013 and a number of recognizable landmarks, including the Detroit Tigers\u2019 Comerica Park. The company saw $3.82 billion in revenues last year, netting $1.2 billion income.\n\n\n\nSo, CMA had a sound position entering 2020. Even so, the first half was hard on the company. Business declined sharply at consumer banking locations, and the first quarter saw EPS shift from $1.85 profit to a 46-cent loss. The bank began to recover in Q2 when state and local authorities began lifting restrictions. Q2 earnings were positive, at $113 million, or 80 cents per share.\n\n\n\nThe positive Q2 earnings vindicate CMA\u2019s decision in March to raise the quarterly dividend from 67 cents to 68 cents per share. The current payment annualizes to $2.72 and gives a yield of 7.4%. This compares favorably to the average yield among peer companies in the financial sector, of 2.6%. And even after the company\u2019s share depreciation of 1H20, the payout ratio is only 12%, indicating that this dividend is safe at current income levels\n\n\n\nArfstrom\u2019s review of the stock points out the generally conservative stance of company management toward combatting the coronavirus economic downturn. Common sense business fundamentals have served Comerica well. \n\n\n\n\u201c[We] believe Comerica will be capable of generating solid returns\u2026 a strong capital position and attractive commercial lending franchise positions the company well... we are encouraged by management's aggressive upfront actions including the significant reserve build in 1H20. We believe that by taking these actions now, the company should be much better prepared to weather any economic storm over the coming quarters,\u201d Artstrom noted. \n\n\n\nIn line with his outlook, Arfstrom rates CMA a Buy, and gives the stock a $46 price target. This implies a one-year upside potential of 23%. (To watch Arfstrom\u2019s track record, click here)\n\n\n\nOverall, CMA has a Hold consensus rating from Wall Street\u2019s analysts, based on 4 Buys, 6 Holds, and 1 Sell. The rating is still feeling the effects of analyst caution, and of recessionary pressures that have not fully abated. The stock is selling for $37.35, and the $41.44 average price target suggests it has room for 11% growth. (See Comerica stock analysis on TipRanks)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenesis Energy, LP (GEL)\n\n\n\nNext on our list, Genesis Energy LP, is a midstream player in the Gulf Coast crude oil and natural gas industry. Midstreamers like Genesis provide the services that move oil and gas from the wellheads to the customers \u2013 transportation, processing, storage, and terminalling. \n\n\n\nGEL\u2019s earnings have been depressed since 2H19, but 1H20 saw a 67% sequential gain in EPS despite the coronavirus pandemic. Net income in the quarter was $24.9 million, up from $16 million in the year-ago quarter. The company will report Q2 earnings on August 5.\n\n\n\nGaining ground during the downturn was a feather in the company\u2019s cap, but it did not change the fundamental reality of the situation: economic times are not good. In response, Genesis cut back its dividend payment. The move came in Q1, and reduced the payment from 55 to 15 cents per share. While a severe cut, the move has some positive aspects. First, it keeps the income stream for investors. Second, it brought the payment into line with income, making it sustainable. And finally, even at reduced levels, it gives shareholders a yield of 8.85%, strong by any standard.\n\n\n\nCovering the stock for RBC is TJ Schultz, rated 5-stars by TipRanks. He points out that Genesis is shoring up liquidity and has a clear path forward with new midstream projects. He lays out the case clearly: \u201c[We] think GEL pays down debt following the recent distribution cut\u2026 Large scale, sanctioned projects projected to flow into GEL system look to remain on schedule, and we still expect cash flow growth here through 2022.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"We think GEL is positioned to weather the current downturn and should be FCF positive for the next several years. As GEL uses FCF to de-lever, we think the valuation multiple can de-risk,\" the analyst concluded. \n\n\n\nTo this end, Schultz rates GEL a Buy, along with a $14 price target. This figure implies an impressive 105% upside potential. (To watch Schultz\u2019s track record, click here)\n\n\n\nOverall, GEL's Hold analyst consensus rating here is based on three recent reviews, split between Buy, Hold, and Sell. The average price target on GEL is $10, which implies a 46% one-year upside from the current trading price of $6.83.
