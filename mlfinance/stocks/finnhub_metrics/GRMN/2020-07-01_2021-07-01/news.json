Soderberg said, \u201cGarmin is performing better than most in the current economic environment.

(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Tuesday by the Department of Justice alleges that Alphabet subsidiary Google uses anticompetitive practices to maintain a monopoly on the search and advertising market in the United States.The lawsuit points out Google's 80% market share in the U.S. search market. The Department of Justice also alleges Google locks out competitors through exclusionary agreements.Tepper On Google's Antitrust Risk: \"This has been a headline risk for years, and it really doesn't change my outlook,\" Mark Tepper, president of Strategic Wealth Partners, said on CNBC's \"Trading Nation.\"Google does have a monopoly on the search market, Tepper said, but questioned the effectiveness of breaking up the company. \"Probably some more regulation, probably a fine, but what's the government going to do? Are they going to take business from Google and then give it to an even larger giant like Microsoft?\"As investors wait to see if Alphabet's hand is forced, we look at some possible stocks that could win from a break-up scenario.Apple Inc: Given its competition against Google in phone search, maps, and smart speakers, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) could be a natural winner in a split of Alphabet assets.Related Link: DoJ Officially Files Antitrust Lawsuit Against GoogleTripAdvisor: The CEO of TripAdvisor Inc (NASDAQ: TRIP) hasn't shied away from his belief that Google is hurting his company's business with some unfair practices.He recently told Bloomberg that Google Search makes the playing field uneven. Shares of TripAdvisor are down 35% in 2020 and have fallen more than 75% over the last five years.Booking Holdings: The owner of online reservation and recommendation sites, Booking Holdings (NASDAQ: BKNG) could be a winner from Google having to change its search practices. Booking Holdings owns Booking.com, Kayak and Priceline.com The company relies on people finding its results through search.Netflix: Alphabet is the owner of YouTube, which is one of the top streaming companies in the world.Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) is a rival, but could also help assign a valuation to YouTube if it was split off as a separate company. Investors and analysts could use a pure play company like YouTube as a comparison of what Netflix is worth.Zillow: Online real estate company Zillow Group, Inc (NASDAQ: Z) is a company that gets traffic from Google search results. A change in Google's practices could benefit a company like Zillow.Garmin: GPS providers like Garmin (NASDAQ: GRMN) have seen the shift of drivers using their phone and apps like Google Maps as navigation devices.Garmin is a company to watch if Google has to make changes to its Google Maps feature.Yelp: One of the biggest cheers for the Department of Justice lawsuit came from Yelp Inc. (NYSE: YELP), a review platform that connects consumers with local businesses.\"By systematically reducing the quality of its search results in order to entrench and extend its search and search advertising monopolies, Google is directly harming consumers,\" the company said in a blog post.Yelp could benefit if Google has to change search practices and allow Yelp results to appear higher in consumers' searches.Photo courtesy of Zillow.See more from Benzinga  * Options Trades For This Crazy Market: Get Benzinga Options to Follow High-Conviction Trade Ideas  * Zoomtopia 2020: Zoom Video Unveils Zapps, New Features To Take On Microsoft, Google  * 5 Apple Analysts On HomePod Mini, Pricing Of 'Premier 5G' iPhone(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The number of ransomware attacks, where hackers encrypt a user\u2019s data files and then demand payment to restore access, climbed by 20% in the first half of the year to reach 121.4 million assaults, according to data security firm SonicWall.Many of the victims chose to pay up. In June, the University of California said it paid $1.14 million to extortionists who\u2019d besieged servers at its medical school. CWT, a travel-management company, handed over $4.5 million worth of Bitcoin last month to resolve a hack, Reuters reported. Garmin Ltd., which sells portable devices linked to global positioning systems, suffered outages in the final week of July it said were due to a cyber attack. While the company hasn\u2019t commented on how it solved the interruptions, various media reports put the ransom demand at $10 million.In the past four years, Kivu Consulting has been involved in more than 700 ransomware incidents. Last year, the cyber security firm\u00a0was the agent for 143 payments worth more than $17 million. So what should you do when the email arrives saying you\u2019ve been hacked, your data has been compromised and if you don\u2019t pay a ransom, your servers will remain frozen? I caught up with Winston Krone, Kivu\u2019s global managing director, to find out. The following is a lightly edited transcript of our\u00a0telephone conversation this week.MARK GILBERT: The number of ransomware attacks has climbed substantially this year. Is lockdown having an impact?WINSTON KRONE: We\u2019re in the middle of a huge wave of attacks right now. Companies are coming back to work, employees are bringing infected computers back into the organization. Attackers have waited. The value of a ransomware attack is much bigger now that companies have gotten through the worst part of Covid and have the money to pay. It\u2019s all about business interruption, that\u2019s why people pay a ransom. If the company\u2019s not working, if it\u2019s hobbling along, a ransomware attack is not going to have the impact it would if the company was going full blast. We had attacks a couple of months ago where the victim of the attacks said, \u201cWe\u2019re not sure we\u2019re gonna be in business, we\u2019re not paying a ransom because we\u2019re not sure we\u2019re gonna make payroll next month.\u201dMG: Given that companies are reluctant to admit to being hacked or paying ransom, how big is the iceberg that we only see the tip of?WK: I would suspect the ratio is about 10/1, based on our metrics in the past four years where we know the number of ransomware attacks we were involved in that went public. There are very few unreported cases for publicly traded companies these days. Four years ago there was a huge embarrassment factor, now there\u2019s no incentive to keep it secret. If anything, there\u2019s quite a bit of sympathy for public companies that are hit with ransomware attacks. Of course, it\u2019s different for private companies.MG: Of the industry-identifiable ransoms your company handled last year, more than half came from manufacturing companies even though they were the targets of less than a fifth of attacks. Why the disparity?WK: Because of just-in-time manufacturing, they aren\u2019t able to go offline even for just a few days. Increasingly we deal with clients who are under penalty clauses if they can\u2019t get stuff out. It becomes a purely mathematical equation as to whether or not to pay a ransom. And the attackers know this.\u00a0The hackers know that manufacturers will pay more.\u00a0MG: Are cyber terrorists increasing the amounts they demand?WK: You\u2019ve got different types of cyber extortion, like with other criminal activity. There\u2019s the young thug who will grab your mobile phone late at night outside the tube station, and then you\u2019ve got sophisticated gangs who will break in to steal gold bullion. Some of the attack groups we\u2019ve seen, they\u2019ll stick to their numbers, a quarter of a million dollars where these companies will just pay it, bury it and move on, and they\u2019ll\u00a0be hitting four or five companies a day. Then you get the guys who are going for the big ones, going for $10 million. It\u2019s grown into an enormous ecosystem. You\u2019ve got groups who will facilitate attacks, you\u2019ve got hackers for hire, you have groups who all they do is dispose of bitcoin.MG: How willing are they to negotiate?WK: It completely depends on the group, and that\u2019s something we stress with clients. In the decision about whether to pay, there\u2019s a bunch of different steps you need to think about. Is the decryption going to actually work? Even if it works, a lot of the ransomware can corrupt things like databases. You\u2019ve got to know the ransomware variant. In at least half of the cases, you\u2019re gonna have to go back to the attacker and get their help to get the decryption going, because it\u2019s not one decryption key for the entire \u00a0attack, every single computer will have its own decryption key, every single infected computer.Sometimes these attackers are dealing with a dozen victims, so we\u2019ve had the decryption keys for the wrong client sent to us. If you want to bring down the price, that can work so long as it\u2019s a bona fide move and you will pay the lower price. If it\u2019s a question of just stalling for time and you play it badly, the attackers will just double the price. The reason you\u2019re paying is to get back online quickly, but you\u2019re losing time haggling.\u00a0If you\u2019re losing $250,000 a day in revenue then messing around for several days to try to bring the price down by $50,000 doesn\u2019t make sense.MG: So it sounds like if you do get hacked, you hope it\u2019s by a more sophisticated player?WK: You want to be attacked by somebody who\u2019s not a complete clown, who can supply you with the right decryption tool to decrypt your data, and who understands that this is a difficult process for you. There are attackers out there who are completely inept and don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. We\u2019ve had situations where, halfway through the attack, the client wanted to pay a ransom, the attacker disappears and never comes back. That\u2019s because other attackers, the head of the Mafia, decides that this group is so bad that they just yank them halfway through the attack. So you want to be hit by someone who\u2019s very technical.MG: Are the ransom payments always made in Bitcoin?WK: Traditionally they were. There\u2019s been a move away from Bitcoin. Attackers know that their ransom payments are being traced across wallets and law enforcement is beginning to be able to track people down. Non-Bitcoin currencies are not as traceable. That said, it\u2019s harder for victims to get hold of other cyber currencies, and the attackers know this.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Mark Gilbert is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering asset management.

(GRMN) confirmed that it was the victim of a cyberattack following many users reporting online outages since last week.Despite the attack, shares were up 4% at market close on July 27 at $100.29 per share.In a July 27 press release, the technology company said that it experienced a hack which crippled its website, customer support, customer-facing applications, and company communications. Garmin products were not affected except for the ability to access online services.According to sources that spoke to TechCrunch, the attack was attributed to a new strain of ransomware called WastedLocker, which encrypts data but doesn\u2019t exfiltrate it. Affected systems can be recovered from backups without having the user or business required to pay a ransom.The press statement from Garmin highlighted that its customer information was safe, saying, \u201cWe have no indication that any customer data, including payment information from Garmin Pay, was accessed, lost or stolen.\u201d Garmin added, \u201cWe do not expect any material impact to our operations or financial results because of this outage.\u201dGarmin states that it expects a return to normal operations over the next few days and that affected systems will be restored. Following the confirmation of the cyberattack, users reported on Twitter, a return to online functionality with Garmin wearables and the Garmin Connect app.J.P. Morgan analyst Paul Chung noted last month that Garmin app download data is an improving trend in light of the pandemic. He says that since May, daily downloads have seen a \u201cswift\u201d rebound for Connect, Golf, Active Captain, and Explore. The analyst sees momentum through June. As of July 28, he maintains a Buy rating on the stock and a price target of $101, which implies 1% upside potential.Overall, 3 analysts assign Buy ratings, 3 Hold ratings, and 1 Sell rating, giving GRMN a\u00a0Moderate Buy Street\u00a0consensus. The average analyst price target stands at $94.40, suggesting 6% downside potential, with shares already up 3% year-to-date.

Garmin did not confirm any of those specifics over the weekend or in their Monday press release. What's Next: Late Sunday night and into Monday, Garmin users were once again able to sync their data on Garmin Connect or other popular sites such as Strava. Garmin said no personal information was taken, including payment information, and added that the functionality of Garmin-enabled products functionality was not compromised.The company said its site and support lines are back up  and running.
