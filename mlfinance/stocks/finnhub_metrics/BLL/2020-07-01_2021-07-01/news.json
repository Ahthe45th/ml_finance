Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Ball has. Ball's Debt According to the Ball's most recent financial statement as reported on February 17, 2021, total debt is at $7.80 billion, with $7.78 billion in long-term debt and $17.00 million in current debt. Adjusting for $1.37 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $6.43 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Ball has $18.25 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.43. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and normal for another. Importance Of Debt Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.

Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Ball has.Ball's Debt Based on Ball's balance sheet as of August 7, 2020, long-term debt is at $7.16 billion and current debt is at $523.00 million, amounting to $7.68 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $643.00 million in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $7.04 billion.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering Ball's $16.61 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.46. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and normal for another.Importance Of Debt Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

To get by, they borrow a combined $1.6 billion of\u00a0bonds and loans\u00a0after already piling\u00a0debt onto their balance sheets several times during the coronavirus pandemic. Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgrades both companies by three levels\u00a0in what\u2019s colloquially referred to as a \u201csuperdowngrade,\u201d citing high leverage and uncertain earnings potential. Analysts\u00a0warn\u00a0of\u00a0additional cuts deeper into junk over the longer term.This was August for Carnival Corp. and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.And yet, in what may seem counterintuitive,\u00a0investors have\u00a0reacted to these developments\u00a0by bidding up prices on the junk debt of the two largest global cruise-line operators.(1)Consider Royal Caribbean\u2019s bonds, which were issued in May with investment grades from both Moody\u2019s and S&P Global Ratings. Now rated two steps into speculative grade by Moody\u2019s, the securities due in June 2025 traded Wednesday at 113.5\u00a0cents on the dollar, the highest price yet. Similarly, Carnival\u2019s debt maturing in April 2023 has rallied in each session since the Moody\u2019s downgrade on the largest trading volume this month.\u00a0It\u2019s tempting to explain this away as \u201cthe bond market had it right all along\u201d and Moody\u2019s is just now catching up to what investors knew about the difficult path forward for cruise lines. Indeed, Carnival\u2019s bond sale almost five months ago was run off of\u00a0JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s high-yield syndicate desk, even though it carried investment grades. It\u2019s\u00a0hardly a secret that the likes of Carnival and Royal Caribbean, along with other travel and leisure companies,\u00a0would suffer the most financially as long as persistent Covid-19 outbreaks flare up across the U.S.\u00a0That explanation doesn\u2019t tell the whole story, however. If Moody\u2019s had moved in line with market pricing, its downgrade would have been even more severe. If anything, the recent rally could be viewed as temporary relief among investors that the credit-rating company didn\u2019t have an even more dour outlook for the cruise-line industry. For now, credit buyers have been given\u00a0the go-ahead to coast on super-high interest rates from this year\u2019s bond sales.The above-par prices on debt from Carnival and Royal Caribbean largely reflect that both companies had to offer\u00a0interest rates of 11.5% for enough investors to lend them cash\u00a0even though the bonds are first-lien obligations and rated two steps higher (Ba2) than their overall grade. Carnival\u2019s debt due in April 2023 yields 6.6% and Royal Caribbean\u2019s securities maturing in June 2025 yield 7.6%. By contrast, the average yield on a Bloomberg Barclays index of double-B rated corporate debt is 3.92%, and the index of\u00a0single-B debt yields\u00a05.51%.A look at\u00a0older obligations provides\u00a0an even more sobering\u00a0view of the industry. Carnival has senior unsecured bonds, rated B2 by Moody\u2019s, that were issued in 1998 and mature in 2028. They last traded at 84 cents on the dollar to yield 9.7%. Royal Caribbean debt with the same Moody\u2019s rating and\u00a0maturing around the same time trades at 74 cents to yield 8.4%. Bonds issued late last year by\u00a0Norwegian Cruise Line, the smallest of the three and\u00a0also cut three steps\u00a0by Moody\u2019s, last traded at 68 cents to yield 13.7%, or 300 basis points more\u00a0than a Bloomberg Barclays index of triple-C rated junk bonds. That\u2019s typically the point at which investors have to separate the distressed companies from those that are doomed.Moody\u2019s, which put the\u00a0companies on review for downgrade on\u00a0July 14, suggests it\u2019s too soon to call for their demise. All have \u201cgood liquidity,\u201d with enough cash to cover needs over the next 12 to 18 months\u00a0and strong positions within the cruise-line industry. In the short run, their businesses \u201cwill be dominated by the length of time that cruise operations continue to be highly disrupted and the resulting impacts on the company's cash consumption and its liquidity profile.\u201d Yet \u201cover the long run, the value proposition of a cruise vacation relative to land-based destinations, as well as a group of loyal cruise customers, supports a base level of demand once health safety concerns have been effectively addressed.\u201d Moody\u2019s\u00a0base case is for U.S. cruising to resume in the first half of 2021. If that doesn\u2019t happen, or if the companies need to take on even more debt to stay afloat, it would consider additional downgrades.That all sounds tremendously uncertain, even for these uncertain times. Carnival\u2019s Princess line has already canceled some early 2021 world voyages, and its Cunard line said it would extend its pause in operations until next year. The fact that the bonds are nonetheless rallying suggests investors are willing to set aside their trepidations \u2014\u00a0as long as yields remain significantly\u00a0above what current credit ratings would indicate.Remember that\u00a0just a few weeks ago,\u00a0Ball Corp., a junk-rated\u00a0aluminum-packaging company, sold $1.3 billion of 10-year securities at 2.875%, the lowest ever for U.S. speculative-grade debt with a maturity of longer than five years. Yes, coronavirus lockdowns are causing\u00a0a can shortage, which would obviously benefit a\u00a0chief producer of aluminum drink cans. But that\u2019s still a stunningly low interest rate for debt billed as high yield.\u00a0If Moody\u2019s says the cruise lines are sound for at least the next year or so, why not clip a double-digit\u00a0coupon and see whether America and the rest of the world\u00a0can rein in\u00a0Covid-19?Meanwhile, high-yield credit spreads are close to the narrowest since before the pandemic escalated, even after August proved to be the second-busiest month for junk-bond sales in history. The relentless rally is opening up the possibility that September may bring up to $40 billion in new offerings. Few borrowers are likely to offer the mix of relatively high yields and major industry-leader positions\u00a0as the cruise lines.Betting on a successful comeback for cruises, after almost half a year working from home and just in the wake of a Moody\u2019s superdowngrade, might not feel too secure. But for fixed-income investors, a sufficiently high yield can assuage just about any fear. In the case of Carnival and Royal Caribbean, that should be enough to continue buoying their bonds.(1) According to Moody's, Carnival isthe largest worldwide cruise line in terms of revenue, fleet size and number of passengers carried, whileRoyal Caribbean is the second largest global ocean cruise operator based upon capacity and revenue.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brian Chappatta is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering debt markets.

It\u2019s about to find out whether it can create a similar reaction among U.S. corporate-bond buyers with its latest debt offering.The technology giant is taking the rare step of\u00a0issuing dollar bonds for the second time in the same calendar year. When Apple borrowed\u00a0$8.5 billion in May, the 10-year portion priced at a yield that was 110 basis points more than benchmark U.S. Treasuries. The 10-year part of the new deal is being marketed at a spread of 75 basis points\u00a0and seems destined to tighten from there. The average yield spread\u00a0on double-A corporate bonds\u00a0has narrowed\u00a0by more than 50 basis points since Apple\u2019s last offering, Bloomberg Barclays index data show, suggesting the iPhone maker could lock in a 10-year rate\u00a0around 1.25%. To put that in context:\u00a0Before this year, the U.S. government itself had never borrowed so cheaply.At this point, few superlatives are left to describe the relentless rally in investment-grade bonds. As Bloomberg News\u2019s\u00a0Molly Smith reported, companies from Amazon.com Inc. and\u00a0Google parent Alphabet Inc. to Visa Inc. and Chevron Corp. have all set record-low interest rates across the corporate yield curve. Chevron\u2019s two-year debt priced with a 0.333% coupon; Amazon\u2019s three-year securities offered 0.4%; and\u00a0Visa\u2019s seven-year bonds offered 0.75%, outdoing Alphabet\u2019s 0.8%.Apple\u2019s all-in borrowing costs probably won\u2019t be lower than those of Alphabet, which timed its deal perfectly and sold debt\u00a0just before Treasury yields increased by the most in two months. But the fact that the iPhone maker is piling into a market already grappling with never-before-seen interest rates might be enough to start causing\u00a0investors to bristle, particularly given the recent wave of encouraging economic data, such as U.S. initial jobless claims falling below 1 million for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic took hold. In theory, such a rebound would lead traders to rotate into riskier assets.Then again, it\u2019s not as if investors are shunning equities or high-yield bonds. Junk-rated\u00a0Ball Corp., an aluminum-packaging company, issued $1.3 billion of 10-year securities\u00a0at 2.875% earlier this week, the\u00a0lowest ever\u00a0for a U.S. speculative-grade deal with a maturity that long. Meanwhile, like much of the technology sector, Apple\u2019s stock price is almost 40% higher than it was in February. The company plans to use debt proceeds at least in part to\u00a0buy back shares and pay dividends.The Federal Reserve is the elephant in the room, of course, even if Chair Jerome Powell has specifically said the central bank doesn\u2019t intend to \u201crun through the bond market like an\u00a0elephant.\u201d Its Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility has bought $55\u00a0million in Apple debt across eight separate securities, according to a\u00a0disclosure\u00a0of purchases through July 29.(1)\u00a0In the grand scheme of things, that\u2019s not all that much, given that\u00a0companies\u00a0have sold almost\u00a0$2 trillion of bonds and leveraged loans just this year. But the backstop effect matters just about as much as the actual amount it owns.\u00a0As I wrote last month, given the company\u2019s tendency to use the money it raises to conduct share buybacks, it\u2019s not quite the Fed buoying\u00a0Apple stock, but it\u2019s awfully close.More important, the Fed\u2019s facility\u00a0creates the perception that there\u2019s virtually no risk in holding investment-grade U.S. corporate bonds \u2014 it\u2019s practically free\u00a0money as long as it offers any sort of yield pickup relative to Treasuries. That\u2019s why investment-grade bond funds have experienced consecutive weekly\u00a0inflows over the past four months that collectively have exceeded $100 billion. Eight of the 10 largest inflows in history have have come\u00a0during this streak:I was asked on Bloomberg Radio earlier this week if there was an asset class I thought had run too far, too fast. It\u2019s a tough question for anyone when gold prices soared above $2,000 an ounce and the S&P 500 Index exceeded its record\u00a0close in just\u00a0175 days. I flagged investment-grade corporate bonds simply because\u00a0these type of one-way flows make me nervous, given their propensity to create both virtuous and vicious cycles. I see the arguments for why there\u2019s more room to run \u2014\u00a0remarkably, average corporate-bond spreads are still 39 basis points wider than their tightest levels from the past decade \u2014\u00a0and wouldn\u2019t necessarily bet on the credit rally fizzling out, let alone sharply reversing its gains.\u00a0But at a certain point, investors in any asset class need to pause and take a breather. That process might not\u00a0begin\u00a0with Apple, but its bond sale is bound to splash yet another jarring interest rate across trading screens.(1) For those interested, the specific CUSIPs are: 037833DV9, 037833AR1, 037833AK6, 037833CG3, 037833CM0, 037833DL1, 037833DT4, 037833BS8.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brian Chappatta is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering debt markets.

That\u2019s in marked contrast to the Fed\u2019s\u00a0splashy foray into buying junk debt for the first time, mostly via exchange-traded funds.So it\u2019s unsurprising that U.S. high-yield spreads (the difference between interest rates on junk bonds and their benchmarks) are tightening much faster than Europe\u2019s. Some new American records are being set,\u00a0such as the sub-3% coupon achieved by Ball Corp. on Monday for a 10-year sale. That\u2019s the lowest yield recorded for a U.S. junk bond of that maturity.The worry for Europe\u2019s policy makers is that junk-rated companies are often an important part of the economy, employing lots of people, so their health is important. Fortunately, the continent\u2019s high-yield market is functioning well for now, but it will need to be monitored as we move into the next stage of a\u00a0fragile economic recovery.At least the European Central Bank has left itself some room to help out sub-investment grade businesses if that becomes necessary, although the Fed is in a better position because it has that tool available already.There are technical reasons too for the difference in the U.S. and European approaches to high-yield debt, and the recent American outperformance.\u00a0This type of credit is less common in Europe; it\u2019s equivalent to less than a fifth of the investment-grade corporate debt in circulation. In the U.S., many junk bond issuers have stock listings too, making them more visible \u2014\u00a0and arguably more important \u2014\u00a0to policy makers.\u00a0In Europe, private-equity vehicles dominate the market.The European market also tends to be concentrated at the higher-quality end of the junk ratings, with the bulk of outstanding euro supply in the BB bucket. Generally there\u2019s a higher hurdle to attract sufficient investor demand. As such, default rates remain low, although the full effect of the pandemic has yet to play out as labor support schemes and access to cheap capital are still freely available.European supply has returned pretty strongly of late. There have been 100 new high-yield deals in Europe worth about 50 billion euros ($59 billion), some 20% higher than at this point last year.

(NYSE: BLL) increased by 19.13% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Ball has.Ball's Debt Based on Ball's financial statement as of May 8, 2020, long-term debt is at $7.48 billion and current debt is at $522.00 million, amounting to $8.00 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $801.00 million in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $7.20 billion.Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Ball has $16.55 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.48. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than 1 means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. For example, a debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry, whereas normal for another.Why Shareholders Look At Debt? Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.See more from Benzinga  * Analyzing Pinterest's Unusual Options Activity  * Understanding Sonos's Unusual Options Activity  * Unusual Options Activity Insight: Slack Technologies(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.
