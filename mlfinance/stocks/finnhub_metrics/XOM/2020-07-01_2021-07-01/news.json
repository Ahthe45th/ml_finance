The starting point is a step change in upstream portfolio leverage that we believe has been masked by the collapse in oil prices. Since 2013, XOM has started over 30 major projects with improved cash margins versus the legacy base business, and enabled by higher oil leverage that was masked by the coincident drop in oil prices.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnother analyst, Manav Gupta of Credit Suisse, recently reiterated a Hold rating on the stock and lifted the price target to $72 (12% upside potential) from $69.
