SME clients will be able to sell their products and services across a comprehensive range of digital and in-person channels.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, both companies intend to bring multiple payment solutions together, complementing Deutsche Bank\u2019s banking offering. This will save merchants from entering multiple contracts with a variety of payment providers.\n\n\n\nSubject to certain regulatory approvals, the JV will cater to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Germany and be based in Frankfurt.\n\n\n\nJohn Gibbons, Head of EMEA at Fiserv, commented, \"Together with Deutsche Bank, we will be able to help small and mid-sized enterprises in Germany do business in new ways, bringing them a compelling combination of solutions and services to streamline their payment acceptance and banking capabilities.\" \u00a0\n\n\n\nRobert W. Baird analyst David Koning recently maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $148 (37.6% upside potential) on the stock.\n\n\n\nKoning continues to favor the stock as he believes that Fiserv presents the fastest and most consistent growth in earnings, driven by improved spending at restaurants and strong economic indicators, like mobility and resurging air travel.\n\n\n\nOverall, the stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 10 Buys and 3 Holds. The average Fiserv analyst\u00a0price target of $142.45\u00a0implies 32.4% upside potential from current levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated News:Danaher Snaps up Aldevron for $9.6B; Shares Spike 5%Kroger Raises Full-Year Guidance on Strong Q1 Results; Shares Jump 4%XPO Logistics\u2019 GXO Prices Notes Offering Worth $800M", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=60afe5f50da1d78571a6f8fae51d72a0d069678d78cc306dbaedbf55bcdbcc1a"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1624267111, "headline": "Financial Sector Update for 06/21/2021: DB, FISV, KKR, BBVA, XLF, FAS, FAZ", "id": 68471820, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?1233307776", "related": "FISV", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "Financial stocks were advancing premarket Monday as the Select Financial Sector SPDR (XLF) was recently gaining 0.40% in value.

The word itself is a portmanteau, composed from financial technology. This is a sector that has risen in importance in recent years. Fintech underlies e-commerce, online banking, payment transfers, stock market analysis \u2013 the list is as endless as the combination of the financial markets and the digital world\u2019s ingenuity. According to the Global Fintech Adoption Index for 2019, the sector grew tremendously, from 16% in 2015 to 64% in 2019. The growth came at least in part as users and customers recognized fintech\u2019s greater agility and convenience when compared to brick-and-mortar banks and retail \u2013 but in 2020, fintech came into its own. The pandemic \u2013 or more rightly, the lockdowns in response to it \u2013 did strangle much economic activity, but it would have been a lot worse if fintech companies hadn\u2019t facilitated our move toward digital banking and commerce. Now it\u2019s well into 2021, and economies are reopening \u2013 but fintech remains firmly entrenched in our regular run of business. So let\u2019s take a look at some fintech stocks, which have been getting some love from the Wall Street analysts. Looking at the TipRanks data, these are Buy-rated stocks, which according to some recent analyst reviews, boast upside that starts at 37% and heads north from there. Let\u2019s see what else they have to offer. Affirm Holdings (AFRM) First on our list, Affirm Holdings, would tell you that sometimes, fintech means telling people, yes. The company operates a \u2018loan via consumer app\u2019 that allows quick purchases at any retailer. Affirm\u2019s consumer loans are detailed up front, with the consumer knowing at the start how many payments will be needed and the exact payment schedule, and there are no late fees. Affirm has partnerships with Walmart and Shopify \u2013 showing the versatility of its model in both brick-and-mortar and online retail. This company held its IPO early this year, in mid-January. The launch saw 24.6 million shares of AFRM issued on the NASDAQ, at $49 per share. That price was well above expectations; the Street had predicted the initial pricing between $41 and $44, while the company itself had initially planned to start the stock in the range of $33 to $38. The IPO, at the higher price, raised just over $1.2 billion capital. In February, the company released its first quarterly results as a public entity. The release covered Q2 of fiscal 2021, the last before the IPO. Among the highlights in the report: $204 million in total revenue, up 57% year-over-year; $89.9 million in revenue less transaction costs, up 141% yoy; and 4.5 million active consumer users as of the end of calendar 2020, up 52% yoy. The company also reported a 7% increase in transactions per active consumer. Despite the successful IPO and the gains in reported revenue, the company\u2019s stock has been slipping since it peaked in mid-February. However, RBC\u2019s Daniel Perlin thinks some serious growth is on the horizon. \u201cWe believe Affirm is well positioned to capitalize on the secular growth of Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) as a payment method at the POS,\u201d the 5-star analyst wrote. \u201cBroadly, BNPL is incremental to merchants & disruptive to alternative forms of payments. Given Affirm\u2019s product offerings, we expect its financial model will support a 30%+ revenue CAGR over the next three years.\u201d In line with this bullish outlook, Perlin rates the stock as Outperform (i.e., a Buy), and his $155 price target implies a one-year upside potential of a hefty 169%. (To watch Perlin\u2019s track record, click here.) There are 10 analyst ratings on AFRM shares, and they break down 6 to 4 in favor of Buy versus Hold, giving the stock a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average price target is $107.60, suggesting an upside of 87% from the current trading price of $57.60. (See Affirm\u2019s stock analysis at TipRanks.) PagSeguro Digital, Ltd.

It was founded originally as UOL\u2019s online payment provider, and has since expanded to point-of-service payments. The company focuses on small entrepreneurs, micro-merchants, small- and mid-sized companies, and consumers in Brazil. Pag has in recent years been moving into digital banking for individual online accounts. Pag showed mixed results in its last financial report, for 4Q20. Net earnings dropped due to an increase in total expenses. By the numbers, the company saw US$69.8 million in net income for the quarter, down 4.1% year-over-year. At the same time, net revenues were up, by 32.6% yoy, to US$388 million. The top line gains were driven by increases in payment volume and users; Pag reported a 61.2% yoy increase in payment volume, while active merchants on the platform rose from 6.3 million in Q3 to 7 million in Q4. In April, Pag made a major move into the mobile world, with the launch of the PagPhone. This is an Android 10 powered smart device, combining functions of a smartphone, POS payment, and a digital bank. It is targeted at small entrepreneurs, who need mobility. Deutsche Bank\u2019s Bryan Keane sees a clear path for Pag, writing, \u201cPAGS plans to move further up market and go after the fast-growing SMB opportunity expecting to reach ~250- 300 hubs and ~6-11% of total company volumes over the next year. PAGS guided to +40% volume growth in FY21, which we believe could prove conservative. Although incremental investments, stimulus, and moving upmarket could weigh on take rate and margins, PAGS should positively benefit from accelerated volumes\u2026\u201d The 5-star analyst gives the stock a Buy rating, with a $75 price target to indicate a 71% growth potential for 2021. (To watch Keane\u2019s track record, click here.) PagSeguro is blessed with a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 3 recent positive reviews. The stock has a share price of $43.07 and an average price target of $66.67, suggesting it has a one-year upside potential of 55%. (See PagSeguro\u2019s stock analysis at TipRanks.) Fiserv, Inc. (FISV) Last but not least, we have Fiserv, a fintech company that aims at the service provider end of the market. Fiserv offers payment services, account and billing products, customer management, and online banking to credit unions, securities brokers, banks, and retailers. The company boasts 1.4 billion accounts globally, including 10,000 financial institutions, 6 million merchants, and 100 million digital banking users. Fiserv processes 12,000 financial transactions per second. Late in April, Fiserv released its 1Q21 results, showing $3.76 billion in revenue, flat year-over-year. EPS, at 44 cents, was flat sequentially and down from the 57 cents reported one year earlier. Year-over-year, cash flow was up; operating cash flow grew 7% to $952 million, while free cash flow grew 8% to $821 million. The earnings release included notice of two expansion agreements. In March, Fiserv made moves to acquire Pineapple Payments, a merger that is expected to close during Q2. In April, Fiserv entered into a 20-year partnership agreement with Brazil\u2019s Caixa Economical Federal, one of that country\u2019s largest banks. The agreement gives Fiserv an opening into the large and growing Latin American market. In his note on Fiserv\u2019s stock, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev acknowledges the company\u2019s mixed data from the earnings report \u2013 but writes, \u201cWe believe the positives far outweigh the concerns. Oddly, the cherry on top of the cake did not garner enough attention in our view. The 20-year agreement with Caixa \u2014 one of Brazil's largest banks \u2014 should be a top 10 relationship for FISV, adding north of 100bps to merchant growth over time\u2026 With Clover GPV accelerating to +36% in 1Q, North America seeing low-double-digit internal growth, ISVs growing +34% and global e-commerce transactions up +24%, we believe FISV is simply executing better than many of its peers.\u201d Dolev rates the stock as a Buy, and his $160 price target suggests it has 37% growth ahead in 2021. (To watch Dolev\u2019s track record, click here.) That Wall Street generally agrees with Dolev\u2019s assessment is clear from the Strong Buy consensus rating, derived from 16 recent reviews that include 14 Buys and just 2 Holds. The stock\u2019s share price is $116.59 and its average target of $140.15 implies a 20% upside from that level. (See Fiserv\u2019s stock analysis at TipRanks.)

The word itself is a portmanteau, composed from financial technology. This is a sector that has risen in importance in recent years. Fintech underlies e-commerce, online banking, payment transfers, stock market analysis \u2013 the list is as endless as the combination of the financial markets and the digital world\u2019s ingenuity.According to the Global Fintech Adoption Index for 2019, the sector grew tremendously, from 16% in 2015 to 64% in 2019. The growth came at least in part as users and customers recognized fintech\u2019s greater agility and convenience when compared to brick-and-mortar banks and retail \u2013 but in 2020, fintech came into its own. The pandemic \u2013 or more rightly, the lockdowns in response to it \u2013 did strangle much economic activity, but it would have been a lot worse if fintech companies hadn\u2019t facilitated our move toward digital banking and commerce.Now it\u2019s well into 2021, and economies are reopening \u2013 but fintech remains firmly entrenched in our regular run of business. So let\u2019s take a look at some fintech stocks, which have been getting some love from the Wall Street analysts. Looking at the TipRanks data, these are Buy-rated stocks, which according to some recent analyst reviews, boast upside that starts at 37% and heads north from there. Let\u2019s see what else they have to offer.Affirm Holdings (AFRM)First on our list, Affirm Holdings, would tell you that sometimes, fintech means telling people, yes. The company operates a \u2018loan via consumer app\u2019 that allows quick purchases at any retailer. Affirm\u2019s consumer loans are detailed up front, with the consumer knowing at the start how many payments will be needed and the exact payment schedule, and there are no late fees. Affirm has partnerships with Walmart and Shopify \u2013 showing the versatility of its model in both brick-and-mortar and online retail.This company held its IPO early this year, in mid-January. The launch saw 24.6 million shares of AFRM issued on the NASDAQ, at $49 per share. That price was well above expectations; the Street had predicted the initial pricing between $41 and $44, while the company itself had initially planned to start the stock in the range of $33 to $38. The IPO, at the higher price, raised just over $1.2 billion capital.In February, the company released its first quarterly results as a public entity. The release covered Q2 of fiscal 2021, the last before the IPO. Among the highlights in the report: $204 million in total revenue, up 57% year-over-year; $89.9 million in revenue less transaction costs, up 141% yoy; and 4.5 million active consumer users as of the end of calendar 2020, up 52% yoy. The company also reported a 7% increase in transactions per active consumer.Despite the successful IPO and the gains in reported revenue, the company\u2019s stock has been slipping since it peaked in mid-February. However, RBC\u2019s Daniel Perlin thinks some serious growth is on the horizon.\u201cWe believe Affirm is well positioned to capitalize on the secular growth of Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) as a payment method at the POS,\u201d the 5-star analyst wrote. \u201cBroadly, BNPL is incremental to merchants & disruptive to alternative forms of payments. Given Affirm\u2019s product offerings, we expect its financial model will support a 30%+ revenue CAGR over the next three years.\u201dIn line with this bullish outlook, Perlin rates the stock as Outperform (i.e., a Buy), and his $155 price target implies a one-year upside potential of a hefty 169%. (To watch Perlin\u2019s track record, click here.)There are 10 analyst ratings on AFRM shares, and they break down 6 to 4 in favor of Buy versus Hold, giving the stock a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average price target is $107.60, suggesting an upside of 87% from the current trading price of $57.60. (See Affirm\u2019s stock analysis at TipRanks.)PagSeguro Digital, Ltd.

A decade or so later, the second business they founded is now worth $95 billion, making it the most valuable U.S. startup.The latest valuation for Stripe Inc., their online payments processing firm, gives John, 30, and Patrick, 32, a net worth of about $11.5 billion each, putting the two brothers among the richest self-made millennial billionaires in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.The valuation figure is at the top of the range Bloomberg News reported in November, when Stripe was in talks with investors. At the time, discussions were for a value of more than $70 billion with the possibility of pushing it as high as $100 billion.Its current valuation puts it ahead of billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX and Instacart Inc., according to CBInsights data, and surpasses the market value of publicly traded rivals including Adyen NV, Global Payments Inc. and Fiserv Inc.The Irish brothers founded Stripe in 2010 after dropping out of college in the U.S. They were previously worth $4.3 billion, according to the wealth index.Snap Inc. founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, as well as China\u2019s Wang Ning are the only other self-made billionaires under the age of 35 among the world\u2019s 500 richest, while U.K. aristocrat Hugh Grosvenor and Walmart Inc. heir Lukas Walton hold the sole inherited fortunes in the group.Stripe, which sells software allowing businesses to accept online payments, has been a beneficiary of the e-commerce boom accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic. The company plans to invest in its European operations, in particular its headquarters in Dublin, to support surging demand and expand its global payments and treasury network, the company said Sunday in a statement.The firm also has a headquarters in San Francisco, according to its website, and counts Baillie Gifford, Fidelity Management & Research and Sequoia Capital among its investors.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ea23d12f0a2689d2820b8c94b91ca6b1c3343583d0d9eaf29c85875950780b8c"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1615795627, "headline": "Tracking Larry Robbins' Glenview Capital Management Portfolio - Q4 2020 Update", "id": 64657477, "image": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/3/14/106657-16157678701373155.jpg", "related": "FISV", "source": "SeekingAlpha", "summary": "Glenview Capital Management\u2019s 13F portfolio value increased from $3.19B to $4.36B this quarter.

It\u2019s different in the stock market, even though there is a tendency to refer to stock investing as a game. Smart investors don\u2019t have to \u2018beat the house\u2019 to come out ahead; this is not a zero-sum game. Rather, it\u2019s a game of strategy. Successful investors will look for some edge, an \u2018in\u2019 that will lead them toward winning investments. This search naturally leads some investors to the corporate insiders \u2013 company officers and board members whose positions give them an inside track on the background that will impact stock prices. To the great good fortune of the investing public, the regulatory authorities require that inside traders regularly publish the stock transactions they make in the companies they run. This generates a wealth of information from the SEC, and TipRanks makes it easy for investors to use the raw data, with the Insiders\u2019 Hot Stocks tool. This tool features a variety of filters letting investors search stocks by trading strategies, making sense of a difficult data set. We\u2019ve used the data to pinpoint a pair of stocks showing two clear signals for investors: A Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, and a recent \u2018informative buy\u2019 from a company insider. Fiserv, Inc. (FISV) We will start with Fiserv, a financial tech company providing services to banks, credit unions, securities brokers, finance companies, and retailers. The company\u2019s products include payment services, account and billing solutions, customer management and online banking, risk compliance tools, and data analytics. In short, Fiserv is a full-service fintech, with customers in a wide range of sectors, including banks, government, healthcare, insurance, telecom, and utilities. After seeing revenues slide in 1H20, Fiserv bounced back in the second half. The top line came in at $3.79 billion for Q3 and $3.83 billion for Q4; full-year revenues for 2020 reached $13.9 billion. While these were considered solid numbers, and beat expectations, the coronavirus impact was felt in year-over-year declines. Earnings, however, fared better. Fiserv registered a profit of $4.42 per share in 2020, for a 12% increase over the prior year. On the insider front, the \u2018informative buy\u2019 here was made by Denis O\u2019Leary, Director and Chairman of the Board at Fiserv. O\u2019Leary spent $1.01 million on 9,100 shares of FISV. Turning to the analyst community, Mizuho\u2019s Dan Dolev believes the company has a lot going for it and a bright future. \u201cFollowing marked organic outperformance vs. peers in 2020, we view FISV on track to impress again in 2021, with strong growth across the board\u2026 Investors often think of FISV as a legacy operator with fewer analytic capabilities than next-gen firms. This is not true, in our view\u2026 FISV deploys advanced analytics to measure every client interaction, investing in automation to improve engagement. While \u2018the journey never ends,\u2019 FISV is already seeing strong success in these efforts, seeing just low-single-digit senior level attrition,\u201d Dolev commented. In line with his optimistic approach, Dolev rates FISV a Buy, and his $160 price target implies a 38% upside for the year ahead. (To watch Dolev\u2019s track record, click here) Overall, there are no fewer than 19 reviews on file for Fiserv, and they break down 17 to 2 in favor of Buys versus Holds. This indicates a broad view on Wall Street that the stock is a buying proposition, and makes the consensus rating a Strong Buy. Shares are priced at $115.80, and their $134 average price target suggests room for ~16% growth on the one-year time horizon. (See FISV stock analysis on TipRanks) Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding (BHVN) From fintech we move to the pharmaceutical sector. Biohaven focuses on neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases, and has a pipeline with therapies in various stages of development, and one treatment which has already gained FDA approval. Last year, Biohaven's NURTEC was given the go ahead for the acute treatment of migraine in adults and has been performing well since its launch. The treatment has another upcoming catalyst on the horizon. The FDA has accepted an sNDA (supplemental new drug application) for the prevention of migraine and a PDUFA date is expected in the second quarter. Turning to the insider trades, on March 2, John Childs, one of the company\u2019s Directors, paid $851,370 for a bloc of 10,000 shares. His display of confidence gets the backing of H.C. Wainwright\u2019s Douglas Tsao. The 5-star analyst anticipates the US approval of NURTEC in preventative migraine followed by an immediate launch. Tsao is also impressed by NURTEC's \u201ccontinued linear growth.\u201d \u201cDespite being on the market for only about one year, NURTEC continues to take share from triptans and even mAbs used in preventative treatment, though the share is still relatively small, suggesting plenty of room for growth,\u201d Tsao said. \u201cImportantly, neurologist and patient attitudes towards Nurtec are overwhelmingly positive, with 58% of patients satisfied compared to just 37% on Ubrelvy, again suggesting robust growth potential based on the drug\u2019s best-in-class attributes.\u201d Accordingly, Tsao has a Buy rating on BHVN shares, to go alongside a $111 price target. This figure implies a 43% upside from current levels. (To watch Tsao\u2019s track record, click here) Biohaven also has plenty of support amongst Tsao\u2019s colleagues. The analyst consensus rates the stock a Strong Buy, based on 8 Buys and 1 Hold. At $103.13, the average price target implies gains of 33% over the next 12 months.
