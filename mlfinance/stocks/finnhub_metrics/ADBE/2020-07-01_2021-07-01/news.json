(SWBI) are expected to report after the market close.\n\n\n\nMidatech Pharma Plc (MTP) was the most actively traded stock in pre-market trading. Recently, the R&D biotechnology company, which is focused on improving the bio-delivery and biodistribution of medicines, disclosed breakthrough in vitro data. The data reflects Q-Sphera\u2019s capability in the formulation of proteins into long-acting injectable products, along with progress across multiple other programs. Per the company, these results offer opportunities for its Q-Sphera technology.\n\n\n\nKULR Technology Group Inc (KULR) was the biggest gainer in pre-market trading as the stock jumped 65.2% at the time of writing. Recently, the developer of next-generation lithium-ion battery safety and thermal management technologies revealed that it has been granted special permission by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DoT) to transport the prototype lithium cells and batteries aboard cargo aircrafts.\n\n\n\nThe special permit authorizes the manufacture, mark, sale, and use of KULR's specially designed packaging for the transportation of prototype lithium cells and batteries. It also permits them to transport prototype lithium cells and batteries contained in or packed with equipment, the company said.\n\n\n\nKULR\u2019s President and COO Keith Cochran said, \u201cKULR's packaging was approved by the US DoT based on its ability to contain potential hazards in the unlikely event that a cell or battery would experience a thermal event. KULR's newly issued special permit allows customers to safely ship prototype batteries that are necessary to advance innovation and contribute to the development of alternative green energy sources.\u201d\n\n\n\nCureVac (CVAC) was the biggest laggard in pre-market trading, as the stock plunged 45.8% at the time of writing. Recently, the clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company disclosed results of its second interim analysis of its international pivotal Phase 2b/3 study in about 40,000 subjects (the HERALD study) of CureVac's first-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidate, CVnCoV. At the interim analysis, CVnCoV reflected only 47% interim vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 disease of any severity, and failed to meet pre-specified statistical success criteria.\n\n\n\nCureVac CEO Dr. Franz-Werner Haas said, \u201cWhile we were hoping for a stronger interim outcome, we recognize that demonstrating high efficacy in this unprecedented broad diversity of variants is challenging. As we are continuing toward the final analysis with a minimum of 80 additional cases, the overall vaccine efficacy may change. In addition, the variant-rich environment underlines the importance of developing next-generation vaccines as new virus variants continue to emerge.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn earnings news, Lennar Corporation (LEN), the home construction company, reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter (ended May 31) results. Net earnings of $2.95 per share surpassed analysts\u2019 expectations of $2.36 per share. It also compares favorably with the net earnings of $1.65 recorded in the same quarter last year.\n\n\n\nRevenues came in at $6.4 billion, beating analysts\u2019 estimates of $5.88 billion and surged 22% from the year-ago period. \u00a0Notably, the company witnessed new orders of 17,157 homes during the quarter, a 32% increase. New home deliveries of 14,493 homes were up 14% year-over-year.\n\n\n\nLennar\u2019s co-CEO Jon Jaffe commented, \u201cWe continue to focus on production costs and cycle times as the homebuilding industry ramps up to meet growing demand. Lennar is uniquely positioned with our size, scale and production oriented Everything\u2019s Included business model to mitigate the well documented industry supply challenges.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn M&A news, Elanco Animal Health (ELAN) will snap up Kindred Biosciences (KIN), a biopharmaceutical company, for $9.25 per share, which represents an approximate value of $440 million. This price signifies a premium of 52% based on the 30-day average.\n\n\n\nThrough this acquisition, Elanco\u2019s expansion plans will speed up its lucrative pet health space, especially in the burgeoning billion-dollar dermatology category. The deal is likely to add an incremental $100 million to the previous innovation revenue guidance range of $500 million to $600 million by 2025, while also offering attractive opportunities thereafter. The acquisition is expected to close during the third quarter of 2021, subject to certain regulatory approvals.\n\n\n\nElanco CEO Jeff Simmons said, \u201cThis highly complementary combination is focused in one of the most exciting spaces in pet health, and one where we see a strategic imperative to build a differentiated competitive offering.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Viavi Solutions (VIAV) proposes to snap up all outstanding subordinate voting shares and multiple voting shares of EXFO Inc for a total value of $430 million. The transaction values the company at $7.50 a share, representing a 103% premium to the June 4 closing price. The price tag also represents a 25% premium to the $6 consideration offered under the \u201cGoing Private Transaction.\"\n\n\n\nIf the merger is consummated, the combined company is likely to be a leader in communications, tests, and measurement over the next decade. Furthermore, the combined entity will be able to invest in opportunistic growth areas while achieving greater operating leverage. However, the proposed merger faces opposition from EXFO\u2019s majority shareholder, Germain Lamonde, who insists not considering any alternative change of control transaction.\n\n\n\nExtended Stay America (STAY), along with its paired-share REIT, ESH Hospitality, Inc., has closed the deal under which they have been acquired by funds managed by Blackstone Real Estate Partners (Blackstone) and Starwood Capital Group. They were acquired for $20.50 per paired share in a cash deal worth $6 billion. In March, an agreement was signed by STAY to be taken private in a 50/50 joint venture between Blackstone Real Estate Partners and private investment firm Starwood Capital Group.\n\n\n\nIn other news, one of the biggest car manufacturers and a global leader in battery and fuel cell technology, General Motors Co., (GM) disclosed an increase in its Electric Vehicle (EV) and Autonomous Vehicle (AV) spending by 75% to $35 billion through 2025.\n\n\n\nGeneral Motors CEO Mary Barra commented, \u201cGM is targeting annual global EV sales of more than 1 million by 2025, and we are increasing our investment to scale faster because we see momentum building in the United States for electrification, along with customer demand for our product portfolio.\u201d", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a68c47e5aca405251e7c7183cdf5f3c656970e63cfb3a099e662c764f2fd3eba"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1623917598, "headline": "Tracking Chase Coleman's Tiger Global Portfolio - Q1 2021 Update", "id": 68323564, "image": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1126216811/medium_image_1126216811.jpg", "related": "ADBE", "source": "SeekingAlpha", "summary": "Chase Coleman\u2019s 13F portfolio value increased from $39B to $43.47B in Q1 2021.

The deal is expected to close in the second quarter.\u201cWhen we made the deal, we didn\u2019t have the money to pay for it, so we actually raised eight hundred million dollars in 21 days,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an exclusive process so there were no bankers. We agreed on a price that made sense for all of us and then we had a time frame to go raise that money to show that we could actually pay for it.\u201dMessageBird, which completed a trio of acquisitions as recently as March, sells tools to companies that let them add a few lines of code to their app or website so customers can text, email, video conference or call in with questions. It also works directly with telecom operators worldwide to deliver SMS and instant message alerts, such as two-factor authentication codes or weather warnings.SparkPost\u2019s technology significantly extends MessageBird\u2019s investment in email, and puts it in more direct competition with companies such as Mailgun and Sendgrid.Participants financing the $800 million fundraise include Eurazeo, Tiger Global, Owl Rock Capital, and BlackRock Inc., according to a statement. Eurazeo\u2019s Nathalie Kornhoff-Bruls will join MessageBird\u2019s board.MessageBird was recently valued at $3 billion by investors and is expected to be ready for an initial public offering as soon as this year. Acquiring SparkPost strengthens its domestic competition with Twilio, now valued at about $67.8 billion four years after it listed at a $1.23 billion market value.Vis said it was still 10-year-old MessageBird\u2019s intention to be ready for an IPO this year, but that it remained an option rather than a goal or necessity. He said the speed and volume of capital his firm was able to raise in just a few weeks showed access to funds was not a roadblock to growth.The SparkPost deal will be a quick turnaround for some of that company\u2019s backers. The Wall Street Journal reported in January the email marketing company had raised $180 million from investors including LLR Partners, NewSpring Capital and PNC Bank, more than half of which the paper said was in the form of equity.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=927bd2e8619f38b6a7099df836774d4030af9e04a677d04237c2acb3f994b2a5"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619603100, "headline": "Wall Street Thinks This Tech Stock Is Cheap: 3 Reasons to Buy Adobe", "id": 66997081, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?325230892", "related": "ADBE", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "Adobe Systems (NASDAQ: ADBE) is one of the largest enterprise software companies in the world, but one Wall Street firm still sees upside.

A new version of Adobe\u2019s Real-time Customer Data Platform is designed to use brands\u2019 own data, rather than insight from third-party cookies, which are already blocked by several web browsers and are soon to be nixed by Google Chrome. The Adobe product introduced Tuesday will let clients ask consumers for permission to use their information, said Amit Ahuja, vice president, experience cloud products and strategy. The cookie has been the foundation of personalized web experiences since the mid-1990s when Netscape first started using the tracking technology in its browser, putting a little piece of data on a user\u2019s computer while they were scanning the internet in order to remember them. Amid privacy regulations, ad-blocking software and the decision by browsers to get rid of them, cookies placed by third-parties that provide advertising and tracking services to websites and brands are disappearing. To reach customers and respect their privacy wishes, Adobe\u2019s customers will have to look for new options, including using data they collect directly, Ahuja said.With the new Adobe software, consumers browsing on a site should expect that it will be much clearer how the site is using their data and why they are being shown certain personalized experiences, he said.\u201cYour expectations for a brand understanding you and knowing you and giving you a personalized experience are really getting higher and at the same time, the counteracting balance is that consumers are correctly placing more value on their privacy,\u201d he said. Another factor in the demise of traditional tracking: companies that collect massive volumes of data in their own services \u2014 think Facebook or Google \u2014 have been less generous about what they\u2019re sharing with others who want to use that data, said Tina Moffett, principal analyst at Forrester. \u201cIt\u2019s really forcing brands, and specifically chief marketing officers, to go back to the basics of marketing and advertising,\u201d she said. \u201cFor a long time, marketers got real slap-happy with using cookie-based level data to personalize.\u201d READ MORE: How Apple, Google Are Killing the Advertising CookieGoogle is replacing cookies with another approach, called Federated Learning of Cohorts, or FLoC, although it, too, is attracting ire from privacy advocates. Adobe said it\u2019s examining Google\u2019s system, although generally Adobe\u2019s software integrates with all major platforms and services that customers want to use. More than half of the clients that Adobe surveyed aren\u2019t using the full breadth of the data they collect to personalize their approach to customers \u2014 often they don\u2019t know what they have and information is stored in disparate systems, Ahuja said. The new Adobe software is being tested by clients such as FedEx Corp., T. Rowe Price Group Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. It will bring together all sorts of first-party data and events to get more complete insight on customers and will let the companies combine that data with information from apps and media websites that use browsers. Adobe\u2019s Target software also uses machine learning to provide real-time predictions of what information or offer to show users next as they move through a brand\u2019s website. One new feature allows clients to find new customers who are similar to their existing best-known users. The software will also let brands share non-sensitive data with each other to better personalize what products they pitch \u2014 for example an apparel company can combine with a jewelry company, giving them data on what types of dresses a certain group of customers are buying so the second firm can suggest appropriate necklaces or earrings. Using these kinds of technologies in combination will be more complex than just signing up to buy information gleaned from third-party cookies, Moffett said, but it\u2019s good for user privacy and brands don\u2019t have much choice. \u201cThe future of data-driven marketing is going to be more fragmented,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s better than using the third-party cookie.\u201d For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b58624598c117751b4b5c5a2d954adb0278108687b12ee483498ebfe6cf6b13a"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619514000, "headline": "Adobe Announces Industry\u2019s First CDP Architected For First-Party Data", "id": 66695390, "image": "", "related": "ADBE", "source": "Business Wire", "summary": "Looking for stock market analysis and research with proves results?
