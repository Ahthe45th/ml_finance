(CRWD) spiked almost 8% to close at $256.61 on June 22, following an upgrade from Stifel Nicolaus. Shares have increased almost 20% this month post its first-quarter results on June 3, compared to an increase of 14.8% over the past six months. \u00a0\n\n\n\nCrowdStrike provides cloud workload and endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services. (See CrowdStrike stock chart on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nBeat-and-Raise Q1 FY22 Results\n\n\n\nIn Q1, the company's results exceeded the Street's estimates with earnings growth of 400% and a revenue increase of 70% compared to the prior year's quarter.  The company also gave upbeat guidance for Q2 and raised its Fiscal 2022 guidance.\n\n\n\nFor FY22, the company projects total revenue to be in the range of $1,347.0 to $1,365.7 million and earnings in the range of $0.35-$0.41 per share. The analysts\u2019 estimates of revenue and earnings are pegged at $1.32 billion and $0.30 per share, respectively.\n\n\n\nAnalysts\u2019 View\n\n\n\nOn June 21, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Brad Reback upgraded the stock to a Buy from a Hold rating and also increased the price target to $300 from $240, which is a 16.9% upside potential from the current levels.\n\n\n\nAccording to Reback, CrowdStrike has yet to achieve its full potential on the customer acquisition front. In Q1, the company\u2019s subscription customers increased 82.4% to reach 11,420 on a year-over-year basis. \u00a0\n\n\n\nThe analyst was noted, \u201cWhile CrowdStrike\u2019s subscription customer count has nearly tripled over the last eight quarters, we continue to believe that CrowdStrike\u2019s opportunity to source ARR growth from new customer\u00a0acquisition\u00a0remains very early days when considering the degree to which legacy endpoint security providers scaled their respective customer counts over time.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs a measure to gauge CrowdStrike\u2019s ability to scale, the analyst compares the company to its peers; Symantec's customer count exceeded 100,000 at the time of acquisition by Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), while McAfee's current customer count is around 50,000.\n\n\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s shares have exploded 146.1% over the past year, but the stock still scores a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 16 Buys and 1 Hold. That\u2019s alongside an average analyst\u00a0CrowdStrike price target of $257.47, implying that the shares are almost fully valued at current levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated News:Moderna Confirms Additional Purchases of 150M Vaccine Doses from European Commission; Shares Jump 6.3%Butterfly Network Soars on Getting a Buy from CowenMicroStrategy Adds Bitcoins Worth $489M; Shares Plunge 10%", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=5e24604dc06a4cf9846c0da38421b4e70d5dc4c6dabaa7918773c131be96c404"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1624416300, "headline": "3 Revolutionary Tech Stocks For The Roaring 20s", "id": 68432643, "image": "", "related": "AVGO", "source": "TalkMarkets", "summary": "Content", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=8ad6c7e22640eb7afd4fb4265135d41b7a97715489fa6e739266c7aaafd901b3"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1624389187, "headline": "Wait Times for Chips Hit Record 18 Weeks as Shortage Deepens", "id": 68421042, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3MmleK8jDjV_m6QI9J04lg--~B/aD03Mjg7dz0xMjk2O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/800cc0797340407005411ca18b157222", "related": "AVGO", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- Chip-starved industries from automakers to consumer electronics will need to wait a bit longer for components, as delays in filling orders continue to get worse.Chip lead times, the gap between ordering a semiconductor and taking delivery, increased by seven days to 18 weeks in May from the previous month, an indication that chipmakers\u2019 struggles to keep up with demand are worsening, according to research by Susquehanna Financial Group.

This indicates a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.6% between 2021 and 2028.\n\n\n\nUsing the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, let us compare two semiconductor companies, Marvell Technology, and Broadcom, and see how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL)\n\n\n\nMarvell Technology is a fabless semiconductor solutions provider of data infrastructure products that focuses on automotive, data center, carrier and enterprise markets. The company\u2019s products are divided into two broad product categories: networking and storage.\n\n\n\nMarvell\u2019s networking products include custom Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), ethernet solutions and processors. Its storage products include fibre channel products and data storage controller solutions.\n\n\n\nLast week, Marvell announced Q1 FY22 results with net revenues of $832 million, approximately up 20% year-over-year, while net loss in Q1 narrowed to $88.2 million from a loss of $113 million in the same quarter last year.\n\n\n\nThe company reported non-GAAP diluted earnings of $0.29 per share versus non-GAAP diluted earnings of $0.18 per share in the same quarter last year. \n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s results for Q1 FY22 include the results of Inphi from the acquisition date. MRVL had announced the acquisition of Inphi in October last year in a cash and stock deal valued at $10 billion.\n\n\n\nFollowing the results, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann reiterated a Buy and raised the price target from $60 to $70 on the stock. Mosesmann said in a research note to investors, \u201cIn what we have coined the Mother-of-All-Cycles, Marvell is, in a sense, the spear point in AI/ML [artificial intelligence/machine learning] data center, 5G infrastructure, and Automotive markets...\"\n\n\n\nIn Q1, the company saw rise in revenues across all its key product lines, with growth in 5G revenues for the seventh straight consecutive quarter. The increase in 5G revenues was driven by \u201cstandard and semi-custom product shipments to Samsung and Nokia, partially offset by a decline in ASICs as deployments in China paused.\u201d\n\n\n\nMarvell expects its enterprise networking business to continue doing well as the market for its Ethernet switches and multi-gigabit physical transceivers continues to expand.  For the second quarter, MRVL expects networking revenue to grow 70% year-over-year, driven by Inphi\u2019s complete electro-optics product portfolio.\n\n\n\nMarvell\u2019s CFO Jean Hu spoke about the outlook for the second half of the year for the networking business at the earnings call, \u201cAs we look forward, we expect a strong second-half ramp compared to the first half in stand-alone Marvell's networking business, including an acceleration in our 5G business from both our own product ramps and an increase in 5G adoption in the U.S. and other regions. From the acquired Inphi business, we expect approximately $215 million in revenue in our second fiscal quarter.\"\n\n\n\nThe company also expects the Inphi acquisition to drive strong growth in the data center and carrier market. According to Marvell, Inphi is the largest provider of Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) 4 Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) that provides high-speed connectivity inside data centers.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to data storage solutions, MRVL anticipates revenues to rise in \u201cmid-teens\u201d year-over-year in Q2, driven by the nearline hard disk drives (HDD) and data center solid state disk (SSD) markets.\n\n\n\nWithin the data center market, Marvell perceives the cloud data center to be \u201csignificantly bigger\u201d than its 5G opportunity and has forecast it growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% to around $5 billion by 2023. It expects this opportunity to be driven by the rising adoption of ARM processors and custom ASICs. (See Marvell Technology stock analysis on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nMosesmann summed up the valuation of the company, \u201cWe see Marvell on the cusp of mega cycles that will last for years in data center/cloud and 5G infrastructure with a portfolio of products/IP and capabilities that we think approaches Broadcom\u2019s infrastructure/data center capabilities.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe continued, \"Given the growth prospects for Marvell in the double digits for years to come, we believe P/E multiple expansion is in order.\u201d\n\n\n\nConsensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 18 Buys and 3 Holds. The MRVL average analyst price target of $60.61 implies approximately 16.3% upside potential to current levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBroadcom (AVGO)\n\n\n\nBroadcom is a designer, supplier and developer of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. The company\u2019s semiconductor solutions consist of complex digital and mixed-signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor-based devices, while the infrastructure software segment includes the company\u2019s BizOps and cybersecurity solutions, mainframe and fiber channel storage area networking solutions.\n\n\n\nBroadcom reported revenues of $6,610 million in the fiscal second quarter, up 15% year-over-year with GAAP diluted earnings of $3.30 per share, a rise of 82% year-over-year.\n\n\n\nIn the fiscal third quarter, AVGO expects revenues to come in at $6.75 billion while adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to be around 60% of projected revenue.\n\n\n\nFollowing the earnings, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated a Buy and raised the price target from $490 to $520 on the stock. Rakesh said in a note to investors, \u201cWe continue to see AVGO well positioned, with leadership in growing markets driven by secular trends 5G and data center, high margins, and strong FCF [free cash flow].\u201d\n\n\n\nIn Q2, the company\u2019s broadband revenues went up 28% year-over-year and made up 18% of its total semiconductor revenues of $4.8 billion. In the third quarter, AVGO expects to sustain revenue growth in double-digits for the broadband segment as rising adoption of 5G is leading to upgrades in fiber, cable and Internet connectivity.\n\n\n\nBroadcom\u2019s networking revenues went up 10% year-over-year and comprised 32% of its semiconductor revenues. While AVGO observed that demand from enterprises has not yet recovered, it expects this demand to pick up in the second half of the year.\n\n\n\nBroadcom expects wireless revenues to increase at 30% year-over-year while its product resales are anticipated to increase in a double-digit percentage year-over-year. \n\n\n\nRevenues from its wireless products comprised 34% of the company\u2019s semiconductor revenues in Q2. (See Broadcom Inc stock analysis on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nAVGO\u2019s infrastructure solutions business made up 27% of the company\u2019s total revenues in fiscal Q2. In the second quarter, more than 90% of its software bookings were recurring subscription and maintenance booking with an average contract span of three years. Rakesh noted that as a result, the analyst expects that AVGO will continue its focus on core accounts.\n\n\n\nThe analyst added, \u201cLonger-term, AVGO noted it expects its Software segment to grow mid-single digits %, though we believe the company sees upside in F21E.\u201d\n\n\n\nConsensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 16 Buys and 2 Holds. The AVGO average analyst price target of $541.44 implies approximately 15% upside potential to current levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBottom Line\n\n\n\nRosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann summed up the difference between the two companies, saying, \u201cThe reason that Marvell\u2019s situation is so much stronger than larger peer Broadcom\u2019s (leadtimes are extended but stabilizing) is because Broadcom is not a share gainer per se, they are a content gainer in sockets they have owned for many cycles.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMarvell has embraced strategically the custom ASIC, ARM, and 5nm/3nm transition uniquely in the world, which gives the company a capability that may only be matched by Broadcom (if they had the extensive ARM capability/roadmap of Marvell),\u201d Mosesmann added. \n\n\n\nBased on the upside potential over the next 12 months, MRVL seems to be a better Buy compared to AVGO.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

(NASDAQ: AVGO) today announced immediate availability of its Emulex Gen 7 LPe36000-series Host Bus Adapters (HBAs)\u2014 the world\u2019s first 64G Fibre Channel HBA. With the release of LPe36000-series, Broadcom becomes the first in the industry to provide a complete portfolio of products that enable an end-to-end 64G data path. \u201cWith the introduction of the Emulex LPe36000-series, Broadcom is now shipping all the technology needed to build out a complete Gen 7 64G network, optimizing mission-critical application performance using Emulex Fibre Channel HBAs for server and storage arrays, Brocade Fibre Channel switches, and Broadcom optics,\u201d said Jeff Hoogenboom, vice president and general manager, Emulex Connectivity Division, Broadcom. \u201cBroadcom end-to-end 64G SAN technology is fueling storage innovation that will drive the industry for the next decade,\u201d said Jack Rondoni, senior vice president and general manager, Brocade Storage Networking division, Broadcom. \u201cSolutions with Brocade switches and Emulex adapters set a new standard for application performance and management simplicity with 64G speed and autonomous SAN technology.\u201d \u201cBroadcom is proud to deliver the industry\u2019s first 64G optic, cementing our place as the innovation leader in performance and reliability-centric optical interconnects,\u201d said Alexis Bjorlin, senior vice president and general manager, Optical Systems Division, Broadcom. \u201cBy providing 64G connectivity for Brocade switches and Emulex HBAs, we are able to power the world\u2019s highest-performing storage networks.\u201d Dramatically improving the performance of most SAN-based applications during testing, Emulex LPe36000-series 64G HBAs achieved the following results: Reduced Oracle data warehousing runtime by 87 percent compared to 32G1PCIe 4.0 demonstrated up to a 63 percent improvement in application performance for dual-port 64G HBAs compared to running in a PCIe 3.0 server1Cuts storage migration times by up to 38 percent2Reduces VM Boot storm times by up to half2 \u201cThe combination of new PCIe 4.0 servers and all-flash arrays demonstrate such high performance margins that they are now capable of consuming all the bandwidth that current storage networks can deliver,\u201d said Kevin Tolly, Founder, The Tolly Group, \u201cThe results of performance testing by Tolly Group demonstrate why all-flash storage arrays should be paired with 64G technology such as Emulex Gen 7 HBAs and Brocade Gen 7 switching.\u201d Emulex Performance Leadership Emulex HBA\u2019s industry-leading performance is made possible due to a record-shattering 10 million IOPS1, which is over 2x higher than previous generation and over 5x higher than the competition. Combined with the industry\u2019s lowest latency HBA response time of 10 microseconds (\u00b5s), Emulex provides the performance required to fully utilize the latest PCIe 4.0 bus bandwidth which is double that of PCIe 3.0. The Emulex LPe36000-series ships standard with NVMe over Fibre Channel (NVMe/FC) drivers providing the highest performance SAN connectivity and concurrent protocol support, empowering datacenters to easily transition to NVMe/FC without a fork-lift upgrade. \u201cWe are seeing that data center customers continue to choose Fibre Channel to power their mission-critical, highly-secure applications,\u201d said Seamus Crehan, president, Crehan Research Inc. \u201cThe Fibre Channel market remains strong, spearheaded by NVMe over Fibre Channel, coupled with growing flash-based storage array deployments. We believe the market will adopt higher-performance 64G Fibre Channel to further increase customer\u2019s ROI on all-flash array purchases.\u201d Introducing the New Emulex SAN Manager Version 1.2 Also announced today, the new Emulex SAN Manager Version 1.2, which extends Broadcom\u2019s autonomous SAN technology to server and storage end-points. Emulex SAN Manager provides single pane-of-glass visibility into every host on the SAN, maximizing uptime by identifying degrading optics on end-points and pinpointing multi-pathing errors and mismatched firmware and driver pairings. Application performance is improved with automatic identification and mitigation of network congestion. Emulex LPe36000-series HBAs, Brocade X7 Directors and G720 Switches, and Broadcom 64G Optical Transceivers are now available. About BroadcomBroadcom Inc.
