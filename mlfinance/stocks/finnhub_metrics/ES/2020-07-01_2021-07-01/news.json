These investments, and the partnerships formed around them, are critical to the commercialization of the technology and to help Eavor scale its already extensive project pipeline. Eavor\u2019s technology, known as Eavor-Loop\u2122, uses the natural heat of the earth like a giant rechargeable battery. Fluids are heated by the earth and circulated in a closed network of underground wellbores, unlocking a reliable and consistent energy source. Eavor\u2019s technology differs from other forms of geothermal in that it is a scalable \u201cgo anywhere\u201d solution, harvesting geothermal heat to generate dispatchable power with zero emissions. In addition to Eavor-Loop\u2019s\u2122 environmental benefits, the consistency of its heat harvesting gives it the potential to directly replace the traditional forms of baseload power such as coal and nuclear. The dispatchable nature of its design also makes Eavor-Loop\u2122 a form of energy storage and thus singularly complementary to intermittent power sources like wind and solar. The investments will also bolster Eavor\u2019s on-going research and development efforts to drive the cost of Eavor-Loop\u2019s\u2122 clean dispatchable power to a price point that is competitive in all markets. Felipe Arbelaez, bp\u2019s svp zero carbon energy, said: \u201cWe see Eavor\u2019s potential to be complementary to our growing wind and solar portfolios. Our expertise and experience also makes bp well equipped to support Eavor\u2019s growth. Technology such as Eavor\u2019s has the potential to deliver geothermal power and heat and help unlock a low carbon future.\u201d John Redfern, President & CEO, Eavor Technologies Inc., added: \u201cI am delighted that with the funding closed in this round we can look forward to bringing down the cost of clean, dispatchable power to a universally competitive level \u2013 an important milestone for renewable energy. The involvement of companies such as bp and Chevron represents a fantastic endorsement of our technology, the progress we have made to date and the promise for its global scalability.\u201d Contact:Eavor Technologies Inc. John Redfern, President and CEO, Director 650-269-2501 john.redfern@eavor.comwww.eavor.com About Eavor:Eavor (pronounced \u201cEver\u201d) is a technology-based Energy company led by a team dedicated to creating a clean, reliable and affordable energy future on a global scale. Eavor\u2019s solution (Eavor-Loop\u2122) represents the world\u2019s first truly scalable form of clean dispatchable power. Eavor achieves this by mitigating or eliminating many of the issues that have traditionally hindered geothermal energy. Eavor instead circulates a benign working fluid which is completely isolated from the environment in a closed-loop, through a massive subsurface radiator. This \u201cradiator\u201d simply collects heat from the natural geothermal gradient of the Earth via conduction, at geologically common and drilling accessible rock temperatures.

Eversource Energy earned $433.65 million, and sales totaled $1.95 billion in Q2.Why ROCE Is Significant Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q3, Eversource Energy posted an ROCE of 0.04%.Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future.Return on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders.For Eversource Energy, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.Q3 Earnings Insight Eversource Energy reported Q3 earnings per share at $1.02/share, which came in-line with analyst predictions of $1.02/share.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * ROCE Insights For Tesla  * Looking Into Ralph Lauren's Return On Capital Employed(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

Eversource Energy reported a per-share profit of $0.98 when it published results during the same quarter last year. Sales in that period totaled $2.18 billion.Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the \"consensus estimates\"; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an \"earnings surprise\", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values.View more earnings on ESIf the company were to match the consensus estimate when it reports Tuesday, earnings would be up 5.1%. Sales would be up 3.86% from the year-ago period.

Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Eversource Energy has.Eversource Energy's Debt Based on Eversource Energy's balance sheet as of August 10, 2020, long-term debt is at $13.70 billion and current debt is at $1.24 billion, amounting to $14.94 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $64.89 million in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $14.87 billion.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Eversource Energy has $42.04 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.36. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and average for another.Why Debt Is Important Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

Over 1 million homes and businesses were still in the dark as late as five days after the storm. Why?The short answer: Utilities girded for another Sandy. They got Isaias instead.While New York-area power providers have funneled billions into protecting their infrastructure from the storm surge and flooding of a Sandy, they say there\u2019s only so much they can do against the wind gusts of an Isaias, which can tear down mature trees and snap utility poles.That means occasional, lengthy blackouts could become the new normal for New Yorkers, particularly as storms grow both more frequent and more severe due to the warming climate.\u201cThese major storms slamming trees and limbs and other debris into pieces of infrastructure are going to cause outages,\u201d said Jon Wellinghoff, former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the founder of GridPolicy Consulting. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to avoid that.\u201dIsaias\u2019s rampage through the Northeast initially left more than 2 million homes and businesses without power, becoming one of the worst storm-related outages since Sandy, which blacked out almost 5 million customers in New York State and New Jersey. As of Wednesday, more than 16,000 outages remained, mostly in Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester counties in New York State and Connecticut\u2019s Fairfield County.About 700 miles to the west, over 600,000 families and businesses were without electricity for a third day after deadly winds cut a path of destruction across Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana Monday.Read More: One Million Lost Power in Storm That Spawned Chicago TornadoThe New York-area utilities maintain the money they\u2019ve spent strengthening the grid in recent years helped them restore service faster than they could have otherwise. But public officials -- and a few utility executives -- say the companies underestimated Isaias, failing to have enough workers on hand to launch into repairs once the fast-moving storm cleared the region.One utility, Consolidated Edison Inc., had to fly in reinforcements from other states after the fact. Governor Andrew Cuomo labeled the companies\u2019 response a \u201clousy job,\u201d while a Connecticut lawmaker suggested breaking up one of the utilities, Eversource Energy, saying it had grown too large and unfocused to provide reliable service.The companies\u2019 post-Sandy upgrades, paid for by their customers, have drawn criticism in the aftermath of Isaias.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like a good investment,\u201d Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority Chairman Marissa Gillett said Friday. \u201cThey\u2019ve spent hundreds of millions of dollars on improvements and ratepayers deserve to know where that money went.\u201dPost-Sandy InvestmentsAfter Sandy, ConEd spent more than $1 billion on grid resilience projects through 2016, according to spokesman Allan Drury. That included flood walls and water pumps for substations as well as systems for containing blackouts in Lower Manhattan so they don\u2019t spread to more of the city. The company has performed similar work in Westchester County, installing switches that can isolate a power outage and cut the number of people affected by 75% when a tree falls over a wire. It spends about $1 billion on grid upkeep each year.Public Service Enterprise Group spent $1.2 billion over five years to shield both its electricity and gas systems in New Jersey from flooding. The company has raised, relocated or reinforced 26 substations and switching stations in flood-prone areas, according to spokesman Michael Jennings.In Connecticut, Eversource Energy has been allowed to spend over $660 million under a infrastructure hardening plan that was approved in 2013. In July, the company said it\u2019s spending $83 million this year trimming branches and cutting trees along 4,200 miles of roads -- work that can pay dividends during storms like Isaias. Yet, some of its customers were still in the dark seven days after the storm hit. In New Jersey, Jersey Central Power & Light spent about $1 billion in its grid infrastructure since 2016.\u201cThere\u2019s not really a magic bullet to protect us at this point from having damage to our equipment\u201d in the face of such storms, JCP&L spokesman Clifford Cole said.Too Few WorkersJames Slevin, president of the Utility Workers Union of America, said the long outages are a sign that utilities don\u2019t have enough workers for maintenance and are relying too heavily on outside aid. ConEd, for example, had 1,650 employees on repair work last week. They were eventually joined by about 2,000 mutual aid and contract workers from such distant locals as Florida, Texas and Wisconsin.\u201cThey rely on mutual assistance and contractors and they\u2019re spread so thin they don\u2019t have the people to put up the wires,\u201d Slevin said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting worse.\u201dNew York state regulators are investigating the matter. \u201cOur initial review is that more resources were needed,\u201d said James Denn, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Public Service, in an emailed statement.One way to minimize wind damage would be to bury power lines underground, but that\u2019s extremely costly. Instead, utilities can take steps such as \u201csectionalizing\u201d grids so that blackouts can be more easily contained. Installing more distributed power generations sources and microgrids can also help.Short of those changes, it may fall to homeowners to take care of themselves. Wellinghoff, for his part, lives in California, where the utilities have started shutting off power during windstorms to prevent fires. He\u2019s about to have two Tesla Powerwall batteries installed at his home, to go with his 8-kilowatt rooftop solar array.(Updates outage figures in 8th paragraph, adds JCP&L comment in 16th.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=788e5f2914b67eb0d454a69d02522c796db8b0800f6e029bafbbc3621c7bc02d"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1597085613, "headline": "Post-Call Utility Preferred Securities Offer 5%+ Current Yields", "id": 38199252, "image": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_192-59bfd51c9fe6af025b2f9f96c807e46f8e2f06c5ae787b15bf1423e6c676d4db.png", "related": "ES", "source": "seekingalpha", "summary": "Regulatory accounting of preferred securities means they are treated like equity for cost of capital calculations.\u00a0 This increases value to the issuer.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=0425c81640345505d697616bfc7be86f781a773d72bbecdeba57e5695cb25f60"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1597083890, "headline": "'Last one out, turn out the lights': New Hampshire governor says higher taxes prompting urban flight", "id": 38199021, "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106656899-1597077770322-gettyimages-1263442470-mm305875_2020080225020943.jpeg?v=1597077831", "related": "ES", "source": "CNBC", "summary": "The Republican governor said New York, Massachusetts and other high-tax states are \"pickpocketing\" residents by taxing out-of-state workers who are working from home during the coronavirus pandemic.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=77882c53038fec0097f877406e6aaaf225ea0e2aab200187c223fad2ae50cf2d"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1597056472, "headline": "Noteworthy ETF Outflows: IWS, ES, PCAR, WEC", "id": 61188154, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?1519434624", "related": "ES", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "Looking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at ETF Channel, one standout is the iShares Russell Mid-Cap Value ETF (Symbol: IWS) where we have detected an approximate $49.6 million dollar outflow -- that's a 0.5% decrease week o", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=f65cb117962312995b02de6f75e33eaf9fd87dddb02c1916b38f3f98c270cd84"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1597056472, "headline": "Noteworthy ETF Outflows: IWS, ES, PCAR, WEC", "id": 60439672, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?1584830669", "related": "ES", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "Looking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at ETF Channel, one standout is the iShares Russell Mid-Cap Value ETF (Symbol: IWS) where we have detected an approximate $49.6 million dollar outflow -- that's a 0.5% decrease week o", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=6fdffabbe30449e9309e3c4f1852daa72ac1f11091f9f6d4be713b82e2a436e8"}, {"category": "company news", "datetime": 1596888000, "headline": "ConEd Calling in Hundreds More Workers to Restore N.Y. Power", "id": 38253398, "image": "", "related": "ES", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- As more than 1 million homes and businesses across the Northeast head into a fifth day without electricity, utilities are bringing in hundreds of additional field workers to help restore power in the wake of Tropical Storm Isaias.Consolidated Edison Inc. has more than 1,650 employees on the job and is getting help from 819 mutual aid and contract workers from as far as away as Texas, Florida, Iowa and Wisconsin. Another 500 workers are expected to arrive this weekend. Jersey Central Power & Light has more than 8,000 at work.Connecticut had the largest outage as of Friday afternoon, with more than 440,000 customers still in the dark. In New York, 390,000 were without power, followed by 260,000 in New Jersey. For some in New Jersey and Connecticut, electricity won\u2019t be restored until Tuesday, a full week after Isaias battered the region, tearing mature trees from the ground and downing utility poles.The blackouts have added a new layer of misery for communities already coping with a pandemic that\u2019s forced a multitude of people to work from home -- now, without electricity. They also suggest that many utilities underestimated Isaias\u2019s impact on customers, despite weather forecasts calling for intense winds and storm-related damage.Connecticut OutrageConnecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority Chairman Marissa Gillett blasted Eversource for failing to adequately prepare given projections by the state forecaster about the storm\u2019s severity. Gillett\u2019s own power has been down since Tuesday.\u201cThey\u2019ll get their day in court,\u201d she said of Eversource. \u201cThey deserve to be held accountable.\u201d She\u2019s considering civil penalties, disallowing storm recovery costs, and longer term punishments, similar to what PG&E Corp. went through over wildfires.Eversource spokesman Frank Poirot said the company\u2019s response to the storm has been hampered by the extent of the damage. More than 1,100 outside workers are helping with restoration and will continue to line up crews \u201cas necessary,\u201d he said. The company is replacing or rehanging 137 miles of line, removing almost 3,500 trees and substituting 812 poles.ConEd maintains that Isaias was more damaging to the electric grid than the company had anticipated. Other utilities, including New Jersey\u2019s Public Service Enterprise Group, said the storm was as bad as expected and that they were adequately prepared. Yet PSEG on Friday still had 50,000 customers in need of electricity and doesn\u2019t expect to restore all of them until Monday. Eversource said some of their customers might not be restored until Tuesday.Fierce CriticismThe delays have drawn fierce criticism from local politicians, prompting New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont to order investigations of utilities\u2019 response to the storm.\u201cThe response from Con Edison to Tropical Storm Isaias has been nothing short of abysmal,\u201d said Jeff Dinowitz, a New York State Assemblyman who represents neighborhoods in the Northwest Bronx that have been hit hard by outages. He said ConEd has failed to invest enough in making its infrastructure strong enough to endure storms.Rebuilding InfrastructureIn the immediate aftermath of the storm, ConEd brought in 500 repair crews from far flung utilities, expecting that would be enough to help restore power to city residents, said utility President Tim Cawley. But once Isaias struck, it became clear to utility managers that more workers were needed to get to the 300,000 customers who lost power in New York City and Westchester County.The storm initially caused more than 2 million outages in New York and surrounding areas as it raked up the coast from North Carolina and up the Hudson River Valley. It was the largest storm-related outage in ConEd history after Hurricane Sandy in 2012.\u201cIn some cases we\u2019re rebuilding infrastructure,\u201d Cawley said, referring to poles, wires and even damaged transformers. \u201cThis is very labor intensive.

Gone were the photos and plants, the vintage typewriter and illustrated calendar. The wall where she had once tacked up a print-out of an inspirational quote was bare. By the time she walked into the brisk New England winter air on her last day, exiting the building where she had worked for the better part of two decades, Konopka didn\u2019t have so much as a box to load into her 2007 Pontiac Vibe.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Konopka\u2019s departure from Northeast Utilities in 2014 wasn\u2019t billed as a layoff. Her employer\u2019s merger with a Massachusetts power company would eliminate 350 jobs \u201cthrough attrition,\u201d the chief executive officer said when the deal closed in 2012. For a while, the staff believed it. The tie-up created a $12 billion company that eventually became Eversource Energy, with about 4 million customers across New England. Management gave reassurances that there would be more than enough work to go around after the deal, Konopka recalls \u2014 there was even a flutter of anticipation about the chance to do projects on Cape Cod.But group by group, over the course of several months, teams were being displaced. Konopka, a web designer, was one of about 200 information technology employees to be laid off. Several not only had to watch their jobs go to foreigners, but also to train their replacements.Many new hires were H-1B visa holders \u2014 mostly young, educated guest workers hired for \u201cspecialty occupations\u201d such as engineering or computer programming that require at least a bachelor\u2019s degree. Created in 1990 as part of President George H.W. Bush\u2019s plan to expand legal immigration, the program had an initial cap of 65,000 approvals each year.Over the past three decades, however, the H-1B visa category has become a reliable mill of temporary human capital. Congress raised the limit to 195,000 in the early 2000s before bringing it back down again \u2014 though thanks to exemptions, most petitions are approved outside the latest 85,000 limit. (In 2018, for instance, more than 200,000 were approved outside the cap.) The population of H-1Bs in the U.S. has swelled to almost 600,000. They now account for about 10% of the U.S. information technology workforce.On Monday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that will increase scrutiny of\u00a0federal contractors' use of the H-1B holders to replace U.S. workers.\u00a0This follows his temporary suspension of the visa\u00a0program in June. Both actions come as the president seeks to protect jobs lost during the coronavirus outbreak and as the November election looms.Many now worry that plugging this wellspring of capable minds will hamper any economic recovery and threaten the U.S. ability to innovate. There\u2019s no doubt that America\u2019s dynamism will continue to depend heavily on its ability to attract the world\u2019s\u00a0smartest\u00a0and\u00a0most accomplished\u00a0to its shores. Yet the experiences of Konopka, who worked her way up from a secretary, and thousands of other displaced workers across the country also tell another story: Americans have plenty of education, talent and experience \u2014 but an ever-ready supply of less expensive and more dependent guest workers gives companies less incentive to invest in them.***Companies have long complained of a skills gap among job seekers who aren\u2019t keeping up with the demands of the labor market. Almost 70% of U.S. employers reported a talent shortage at the end of 2019. Businesses rank engineers and IT personnel, including cybersecurity experts, network administrators and technical support, among the top five roles that are hardest to fill, according to the Manpower Group.Believers in the skills gap aren\u2019t limited to board rooms and C-suites. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, editorial pages, think tanks, universities and other worthy institutions have fretted about America\u2019s competitiveness. President Barack Obama warned about this generation\u2019s \u201cSputnik moment,\u201d while his advisory council blasted schools for \u201cfailing systematically\u201d to produce enough students interested in science, technology, engineering and math.In 2017, the administration of President Donald Trump directed the Department of Education to channel at least $200 million a year toward STEM, noting that coding skills are critical for high-paying jobs. Too few schools are providing students an adequate foundation in STEM and computer science, the president said.It\u2019s true that the U.S. K-12 education system has serious problems and needs sustained improvement. Average U.S. test scores are mediocre, and the U.S. can\u2019t hope to succeed in the 21st century if its high school graduates aren\u2019t competent in science and mathematics. But as the demographer Michael Teitelbaum, author of \u201cFalling Behind? Boom, Bust and the Global Race for Scientific Talent,\u201d has noted, \u201cthere is a big disconnect between this broad educational imperative and the numerically limited scope of the science and engineering workforce.\u201d \u00a0In most countries, only 5% to 10% of the labor pool ends up in occupations that require high levels of science and math, almost all of which draw upon students who were in the top-performing quartile of high-school test-takers. To determine if the U.S. educational system is failing to produce enough high-skilled workers, it\u2019s more instructive to look at how the best students are faring.There, the outlook is much brighter. American citizens and permanent residents have been graduating with a record number of bachelor\u2019s degrees in computer science and engineering over the past five years. In 2018, U.S. colleges and universities awarded roughly 365,000 undergraduate STEM degrees(2), up 60% from a decade earlier, according to calculations based on data from\u00a0the National Center for Education Statistics. Of that total, 92% went to Americans and permanent residents. Meanwhile, test scores among seniors majoring in computer science in the U.S. \u201csubstantially outperform\u201d those in China, India and Russia, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\u00a0\u201cThe skills advantage of the United States is not because it has a large proportion of high-scoring international students,\u201d\u00a0a group of academics and experts found.It's important to note that these areas of study \u2014\u00a0and the occupations they may lead to \u2014\u00a0tend to\u00a0get jumbled in conversations about STEM. But distinctions are critical: Just as emerging markets can\u2019t be considered a monolithic asset class, the STEM labor market is almost impossible to assess as a whole. At any given time, some fields will be doing well, and others won\u2019t.To assess the skills gap, then, it makes sense to look at the sector where most H-1Bs are heading: technology. In fiscal 2019, two-thirds of approved H-1B petitions were for computer-related occupations, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Are these guest workers filling a dire shortage?The data suggest otherwise. In 2018, the U.S. had between 95,500 and 143,000 job openings in IT occupations that typically went to candidates with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher in computer science or engineering, according to Hal Salzman, a professor at Rutgers University\u2019s Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy. American citizens and permanent residents earned about 100,000 degrees in computer science or related engineering fields, filling the low end of that estimate. But unlike in law or medicine, in technology you don\u2019t need a computer science degree to work: In fact, two-thirds of new entrants in IT occupations major in other disciplines. That means most openings can be filled from a much larger pool of qualified candidates \u2014 just consider any number of the 1.8 million Americans who graduate each year.Even if you insisted on filling these jobs only with computer science majors \u2014 an approach that neither Steve Jobs nor Bill Gates would theoretically endorse \u2014 creating another 40,000 or so to meet the top end of demand shouldn\u2019t be difficult: According to Salzman, this field has the second-lowest STEM credit requirement of all such majors. \u00a0Set this broader pool against the inflow from abroad, which included 53,000 foreign graduates with degrees in computer science or related engineering fields, as well as 48,000 initial H-1Bs destined for computer occupations in 2018, not to mention the tens of thousands of potential applicants, if not more, from the alphabet soup of other visa categories. What we see is an industry awash with supply. \u201cThe story in Washington is that we have this STEM skills gap and U.S. students are just not capable. What the data shows you is that, in fact, U.S. students are both interested and capable of doing this kind of work,\u201d said Ronil Hira, an associate professor of political science at Howard University who studies visa programs. \u201cNone of the evidence indicates a significant shortage.\u201dEven job-opening forecasts can\u2019t always be taken at face value. As a recent report on undergraduate enrollment in computer science by the National Academy of Sciences notes: \u201cMany estimates come primarily from sources tied to industry, which could be argued has some incentive to justify a more favorable hiring environment \u2014 to expand the pool of potential hires and create more competition, leading to more highly qualified talent and enabling them to offer lower wages.\u201dIndeed, any armchair economist can tell you that if laborers were truly scarce, employers would be scrawling out bigger paychecks with fat signing bonuses and generous benefits. Yet as with the rest of the economy, wages in many computer occupations have flat-lined. In two of the fastest-growing fields \u2014 software developers and information security analysts(3)\u2014 average annualized wages grew 0.1% and 0.9% from 2014 to 2019, according to Salzman and Khudodod Khudododov, a research analyst at Rutgers. That compares with 0.9% for nurse practitioners, zero growth for accountants and auditors, and a decline of 0.4% for management analysts, which includes consultants. In short, no one is doing particularly well, and coding skills are no ticket out of that.\u00a0True, overall wages in the tech sector are higher than in other fields. The median annual wage for computer and IT occupations is $88,240, more than double the level for other jobs. That doesn\u2019t mean the industry is growing. Layoffs have accelerated, with 64,166 job cuts in 2019, up 351% from a year earlier. That outpaces the number of new hires planned by three to one, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. Salzman and Khudododov\u00a0found computer programming employment sank 34% from 2014 to 2019\u00a0\u2014 a curious trend for an industry facing a shortage.Another metric to consider is vacancies. Do these postings languish on job boards? Andrew Weaver, an assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\u2019s School of Labor and Employment Relations, found that persistent hiring problems are much less common than the prevailing skills gap narrative suggests: In IT, just 11% to 15% of U.S. help desks faced extended vacancies, compared with 16% to 25% for manufacturing \u2014 even though IT positions require more education and training. Typically, you\u2019d expect just the opposite: In a tight labor market, higher-skilled positions would see more long-term openings, Weaver said.\u00a0Even those hard-to-fill positions can be a consequence of too many good applicants, according to Peter Cappelli, a professor at Wharton and author of \u201cWhy Good People Can\u2019t Get Jobs.\u201d Filtering software weeds out resumes that don\u2019t meet an employer\u2019s qualifications. \u201cIn this case, it might pay off for employers to wait for someone who is perfect for the job, not merely qualified, or even see who will do the job at a wage well below the market rate,\u201d he wrote. \u201cJust as there is no shortage of diamonds even though they are expensive \u2014 you can buy all you want at the market price \u2014 not being able or willing to pay the market price for talent does not constitute a shortage.\u201d\u00a0And this is precisely what\u2019s happening with H-1B workers and their American counterparts.\u00a0Technically, employers must pay H-1Bs a \u201cprevailing wage,\u201d which should match or exceed what a comparable American would make. (Contrary to popular belief, the H-1B application process does not require employers to make any effort to hire Americans first.) This wage level\u00a0is to prevent undercutting U.S. workers and exploiting foreigners.\u00a0In practice, though, companies have ample discretion in setting this level, and often find\u00a0loopholes, such as hiring through outsourcing firms. A recent paper by Hira and Daniel Costa for the Economic Policy Institute concludes that companies in the D.C. metro area got a 36% discount from the median wage level for the most common certified H-1B occupation (a category of software developers) in the wage bracket for entry-level positions, a difference of $41,746 per employee in fiscal 2019. The discount came to 18%, or $20,863, for the second-lowest bracket. This can amount to billions of dollars of potential savings for employers. Hira and Costa found that the Labor Department certified 60% of H-1B jobs at levels well below the local median wage for the occupation.\u00a0These visa holders are not only less expensive, they also have less bargaining power vis-\u00e0-vis their employers. For no small number of them, what begins as a promising career entry point often ends up becoming a version of \u201cbonded labor,\u201d says Salil Choudhary, a former H-1B holder who became an American citizen in 2010. When immigration status is tied solely to an employer, problems such as getting underpaid and overworked often go unreported, for fear of retribution. Choudhary, who studied as an engineer in India, recalls getting sucked into projects without getting paid for overtime. \u201cIf you\u2019re working 16-hour days, you\u2019re taking two jobs from the U.S. market...\u00a0In every way you are screwing up the system,\u201d he said. And equalizing salaries isn\u2019t necessarily the answer if it means employees are forced to work 18- or 19-hour days \u2014 a prospect most U.S. workers wouldn\u2019t stomach.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve created a low-cost, high retention indentured servant model,\u201d said Bruce Morrison, an immigration lobbyist and former Democratic congressman who helped write the original H-1B statute. \u201cThat\u2019s what Americans are competing with, and they\u2019re too smart to compete, so they go somewhere else.\u201d\u00a0So rather than drawing America\u2019s sharpest minds into technology, a combination of depressed wage growth, high churn, long hours and a lack of employee development in effect encourages talented graduates to pursue more lucrative fields, such as finance. Remember, most tech employees aren\u2019t sitting around foosball tables sipping kale smoothies on Sand Hill Road. They\u2019re more likely to be in a back office\u00a0somewhere in Jersey City or Tampa.\u00a0***\u00a0Such considerations were absent from Big Tech\u2019s response to the Trump administration\u2019s restrictions on H-1Bs. Instead, a chorus of titans blasted the White House for narrowing the path for the world\u2019s best and brightest to come spur American innovation. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google-owner Alphabet Inc. and an Indian immigrant himself, tweeted: \u201cImmigration has contributed immensely to America\u2019s economic success, making it a global leader in tech, and also Google the company it is today.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0But H-1B visa holders are not immigrants. (Nor are they as exceptional in their qualifications as other employment visa categories.) They are guest workers with a three- to six-year limit on their stay that's often extended, stuck in a \u201cweird netherworld\u201d of being \u201cpermanently temporary,\u201d says the EPI\u2019s Costa. They pay U.S. taxes but receive few of the protections that American workers enjoy \u2014 namely, unemployment insurance.\u00a0The data can be hard to parse, but a large share of H-1Bs are eventually sponsored for permanent residency by companies, and\u00a0a big portion of green card applications are for people on H-1B visas. Given the backlog of applicants, though, it can take years, and decades in the case of many Indian tech workers, to get one. Meanwhile, H-1B holders with pending green cards have very little job mobility \u2013 that is, the ability to switch employers. Keep in mind, too, that companies have the option to directly sponsor workers who are still abroad, which used to be more common, according to Hira. \u201cThe green card backlogs and employer preferences have made the H-1B a principal, but not only, way station to the green card,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cEmployers like the try-before-you-buy feature of this system.\u201d\u00a0In this way, H-1Bs have become an unfortunate prop in the narrative that the U.S. has an urgent unmet economic need that its\u00a0struggling educational\u00a0and immigration systems can\u2019t fill.\u00a0Deep-pocketed tech companies that lobby Washington on immigration are joined by universities and research institutions seeking to expand their STEM programs and attract foreign students willing to pay top dollar tuition, in part to get into the U.S. employment pipeline. As Teitelbaum observes, what\u2019s emerged is an elaborately successful campaign to keep labor and capital flowing.\u00a0Teitelbaum sees at least five distinct \u201calarm-boom-bust\u201d talent shortage cycles, which the U.S. has repeated every 10 to 20 years since World War II. Politicians, the business community, an institutional report or the media express concerns that the U.S. lags international peers in science and engineering; the government duly boosts the supply of students and workers; a flooded market becomes prone to shocks; suddenly, a cohort of bright-eyed graduates who\u2019ve spent years in labs and libraries find themselves in a lousy job market with few career prospects. Younger generations of students get discouraged and pursue different career paths, and so the cycle begins anew. You can trace this in endeavors from nuclear weaponry and the space race to the war on cancer, peak Cold War defense spending, and boom-busts in tech and biomedical research.\u00a0Now we might find ourselves looking at another kind of bust, with 17\u00a0million unemployed\u00a0and roughly a third of those jobs\u00a0possibly\u00a0never coming back. The tech industry has shed more than 72,000 jobs since the coronavirus was declared a pandemic, according to one industry tracker. Then consider\u00a0the other STEM labor markets that might be affected. Aeronautical engineers, for example, now face diminishing prospects with the airline industry in shambles. Airbus SE and Boeing Co. together have plans to cut more than 30,000 workers.\u00a0As we pick through the rubble of a labor market ravaged by Covid-19, a critical question will be how to get unemployed Americans from occupations that have gone bust into other fields. \u201cA laid-off aeronautical engineer could become a very successful Silicon Valley tech worker,\u201d said Teitelbaum. \u201cBut not if you aren\u2019t willing to retrain him.\u201d\u00a0For years, the steady flow of relatively cheap, ready-to-work H-1Bs has helped diminish incentives for many companies to invest in training and development. In a 2011 op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, Cappelli, the Wharton professor, wondered how businesses could complain of difficulties finding qualified candidates with unemployment hovering just below a post-recession high of 10%. He noted that blame gets passed around \u2014 schools are failing, immigration policy is insufficient and Americans are lacking skills. \u201cBut I believe that the real culprits are the employers themselves,\u201d he wrote.\u00a0Not much has changed in the years since. Though companies in North America spent $169.4 billion on training last year, workers and managers are dissatisfied with the outcome. Government programs such as Trade Adjustment Assistance, which helps employees displaced by globalization trends, have been largely written off as ineffective.\u00a0Academics like Weaver at Illinois have proposed better coordination between employers and community colleges or universities. This approach would not only widen students\u2019 job-search networks and help companies design roles that better suit the future workforce, it also ensures that the skills being taught match up with requirements. Often, hiring managers ratchet up specifications during a downturn to help screen out the inevitable flood of candidates. That means employers sifting through the current pool of applicants will have their pick, but they could be eliminating people with decades of experience, like Konopka, whose talents aren't easily identified by an algorithm.\u00a0Konopka ended up using her TAA assistance to finish a graphic design degree, and she works as an artist with two shops on Etsy where she sells her prints\u00a0and restored photographs. She went from making $90,000 a year to $35,000. But even if the labor force has lost her IT expertise, at least she's\u00a0now content. The quote she once had on her wall was, \u201cEverything you want is on the other side of fear\u201d \u2014 and notwithstanding a $4,000 health-insurance deductible, Konopka swears she will never go back to IT. \u201cI\u2019d prefer to work for myself,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m an artist now, because nobody can replace my art.\u201d\u00a0***\u00a0Rather than shepherding exceptional talent to the U.S. and turning them into Americans, the H-1B system\u00a0has given companies a steadily expanding supply of guest workers who are themselves stuck in indentured limbo. As Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia wrote recently in an opinion piece, \u201cThe H-1B program was never intended to create a pool of foreign labor that displaces Americans\u2019 opportunities for good-paying jobs.\u201d\u00a0Trump\u2019s latest executive order\u00a0could set some much needed H-1B reforms in motion. For one, it seeks to close a loophole that enabled companies to hire guest workers \u2014 through outsourcing firms \u2014 without\u00a0attesting to the Labor Department that\u00a0they could cost Americans like Konopka their jobs or hurt their wages.\u00a0(Outsourcing firms themselves theoretically must be able to\u00a0 support these claims\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but of course their\u00a0employees aren\u2019t affected, as Scalia noted at the signing.) Meanwhile, increased collaboration between the Departments of\u00a0Labor and Homeland Security, announced Friday, means that the secretary of labor\u00a0is more likely to initiate\u00a0fraud investigations, rather than waiting for complaints to be filed. These measures are part of a\u00a0broader\u00a0revamp\u00a0of the H-1B program\u00a0the White House has initiated, with more likely to follow in the coming weeks, Bloomberg News reported.\u00a0\u00a0Yet some of the more substantial regulatory changes on the table never managed to get legislative traction before the coronavirus, and may not advance in a Biden administration. Absent enforcement of these proposals, Trump\u2019s June order mostly\u00a0imposes a blunt and temporary ban that has thrown thousands of lives into chaos.\u00a0If the U.S. is going to compete in the global race for talent, it needs to offer the best and the brightest workers less convoluted pathways to legal immigration, instead of false promises that lead to exploitation and decades-long waiting lists. And if the U.S. is equally committed to providing its citizens with the broadest range of opportunities, as it should be, companies must also be able to prove they have found candidates who legitimately fill needs that domestic workers can\u2019t. A system in which Americans have to train their replacements doesn\u2019t pass the test. Until we find a better balance between those needs, our broken labor market will remain a collection of easily replaceable parts.(1) The NCES definition does not include health-related fields.(2) The BLS category for software developers includes software quality assurance analysts and testers.
