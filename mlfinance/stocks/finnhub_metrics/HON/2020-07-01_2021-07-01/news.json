Tusa believes investors have not fully understood Honeywell\u2019s growth potential. \u201cInvestors underappreciate the many growth initiatives Honeywell has embedded in its portfolio that are on the cusp of bearing fruit in the middle of key early stage secular trends,\" noted Tusa. Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 8 Buy and 5 Hold ratings. The average analyst price target of $237.82 implies 5.70% upside potential to current levels. HON scores a \u201cPerfect 10\u201d on TipRanks\u2019 Smart Score rating system, implying the stock will likely outperform the market.

The company is working with advisers as it weighs alternatives, which could also include a commercial partnership with a major manufacturer, they said.Aspen Tech makes software for companies in industries such as chemicals, manufacturing, energy, metals and mining, its website shows. Shares of the company rose as much as 2.9% Wednesday, hitting the highest intraday level in two weeks. They were up 1.1% at 9:49 a.m. in New York, giving Aspen Tech a market value of $9.5 billion.The company has long been considered an attractive takeover target for big industrial companies looking to expand in software. However, high price expectations and management reluctance have been hurdles for a full sale over the years despite interest from potential acquirers, the people said.Deliberations are ongoing and may not lead to a transaction, the people said. A representative for Bedford, Massachusetts-based Aspen Tech declined to comment.Industrial firms have been shifting their focus from machinery to technology and automation. Last year, Aveva Group Plc agreed to acquire industrial-software maker Osisoft for about $5 billion, while Emerson Electric Co. agreed to buy Open Systems International Inc. for $1.6 billion.Software companies also have sometimes sought investments from potential buyers, including industrial companies. In 2018, Rockwell Automation Inc. agreed to make a $1 billion equity investment in industrial software company PTC Inc. as part of a strategic partnership, according to a statement at the time.Honeywell International Inc., which has been seeking to marry software capabilities with its industrial know-how, agreed in December to acquire Sparta Systems for $1.3 billion to gain technology used in the life sciences industry.

Meanwhile, Honeywell\u2019s (HON) revenues in 1Q remained flat year-on-year but still came in ahead of consensus estimates of $8.08 billion. The aerospace and building technologies conglomerate reported revenues of $8.45 billion. Honeywell\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Darius Adamczyk said, \u201cHoneywell delivered a strong start to 2021 with first-quarter results that exceeded our expectations.

Our new offerings in growing markets like life sciences are gaining traction and the industries that were hardest hit by the pandemic are expected to improve throughout the year,\u201d Adamczyk added. Revenues from HON\u2019s aerospace segment fell 22% year-on-year on an organic basis to $2.63 billion but segment margin was up 110 basis points to 29% as a result of effective cost-management and one-time benefits. The company\u2019s building technologies segment returned a 2% year-on-year organic growth in sales to $1.4 billion, \u201cdriven by strong bookings for services and security products\u201d. The safety and productivity solutions business saw a 49% year-on-year rise in revenues to $2.1 billion fueled by double digit orders growth driven by rising demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) and other productivity solutions. (See Honeywell stock analysis on TipRanks) The company also raised its guidance for FY21 and expects growth in organic sales to be in the 3% to 5% range. HON has forecasted adjusted EPS to be between $7.75 and $8.00, an increase of $0.15 from the low end of the earlier guidance range. The company expects free cash flow of between $5.2 billion and $5.5 billion. Following the earnings, Oppenheimer analyst Christopher Glynn assigned a Hold on the stock. Glynn said in a note to investors, \u201cAero OM [operating margin] was exceptional at 29.0%, or ~28% excl. one-time/$30M benefit with the latter metric still strikingly high and flattish vs. record 1Q20 Aero OM. Robust operations seem accounted for in valuation.\u201d Overall, consensus on the Street is a Moderate Buy based on 6 Buys and 4 Holds. The average analyst price target of $230.22 implies that the stock has upside potential of 2.5% to current levels.

Our new offerings in growing markets like life sciences are gaining traction and the industries that were hardest hit by the pandemic are expected to improve throughout the year,\u201d Adamczyk added.Revenues from HON\u2019s aerospace segment fell 22% year-on-year on an organic basis to $2.63 billion but segment margin was up 110 basis points to 29% as a result of effective cost-management and one-time benefits.The company\u2019s building technologies segment returned a 2% year-on-year organic growth in sales to $1.4 billion, \u201cdriven by strong bookings for services and security products\u201d.The safety and productivity solutions business saw a 49% year-on-year rise in revenues to $2.1 billion fueled by double digit orders growth driven by rising demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) and other productivity solutions. (See Honeywell stock analysis on TipRanks)The company also raised its guidance for FY21 and expects growth in organic sales to be in the 3% to 5% range. HON has forecasted adjusted EPS to be between $7.75 and $8.00, an increase of $0.15 from the low end of the earlier guidance range. The company expects free cash flow of between $5.2 billion and $5.5 billion.Following the earnings, Oppenheimer analyst Christopher Glynn assigned a Hold on the stock. Glynn said in a note to investors, \u201cAero OM [operating margin] was exceptional at 29.0%, or ~28% excl. one-time/$30M benefit with the latter metric still strikingly high and flattish vs. record 1Q20 Aero OM. Robust operations seem accounted for in valuation.\u201d Overall, consensus on the Street is a Moderate Buy based on 6 Buys and 4 Holds. The average analyst price target of $230.22 implies that the stock has upside potential of 2.5% to current levels.Related News:AT&T\u2019s 1Q Results Beat Estimates; Shares Up 5%Snap Breaks Even In 1Q As Results Beat Estimates; Shares Up 5%Skyworks Snaps Up Silicon Labs\u2019 Infrastructure and Automotive Business For $2.75B", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=f54ee3dd25b2354352f52d504372c7bced03eb8a7fb9fcecca210ae0f5903670"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619411940, "headline": "S&P 500: Why Stocks Are Headed Higher From Here", "id": 66460610, "image": "", "related": "HON", "source": "TalkMarkets", "summary": "Content", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=44ff3b94ab7edf0c9602c63d5ac661a2cd6a4bdd4b80f29ef1dabd90ee151e37"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619212827, "headline": "4 Top Stock Trades for Monday: SNAP, INTC, HON, INO", "id": 66392479, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/l4Hl5z27TE44lVrFLPboLw--~B/aD00MDA7dz03Mjg7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/investorplace_417/057e4deb597436fffec6ec8d3ee8d683", "related": "HON", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "The market has been all over the place this week. After stocks looked fatigued, we had a routine dip. As bulls were buying that dip and stocks were rotating higher, a midday jolt on Thursday rattled investors. After a night to ponder, bulls were back to buying stocks on Friday. With all of that in mind, let\u2019s look at a few top stock trades for Monday. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 1: Snap (SNAP) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Snap (NYSE:SNAP) had a great post-earnings reaction in early trading, with a nice pop to the upside after solid results. But investors have sold those results. That would be less concerning if the market was performing poorly on the day. But the market \u2014 and tech specifically \u2014 is not performing poorly. So it\u2019s a bit discouraging to see investors sell the rally in Snap. That said, the dip didn\u2019t do much technical damage.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips I will like Snap more on a move over $60, allowing it to clear this cluster of moving averages. Above that puts stout resistance in play near $65. If we can get a move over $60, then perhaps the stock can challenge the $70 to $73 area and the all-time highs. 7 Retail Stocks With E-commerce Locked In On the downside, however, a close below the 100-day moving average likely puts a weekly-down scenario in play. If that unfolds, $48 to $50 could be on the table. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 2: Intel (INTC) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider While semiconductor stocks are trading well on Friday, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is not. However, it\u2019s bouncing right where it needs to. Shares tested right down to the March low and the 100-day moving average. These levels acted as support, allowing shares to bounce. Keep an eye on this level, near $57.90. A close below this mark puts it below the 100-day moving average and gives traders a monthly-down rotation. That opens up $55 and the 200-day moving average. On the upside, though, look for a move over $60. That\u2019s followed by a potential gap-fill up toward $62.25. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 3: Honeywell (HON) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Honeywell (NYSE:HON) is enduring a modest dip on Friday, after the company reported earnings before the open. After a nice push to new all-time highs, shares are dipping down to the 21-day moving average. With buyers stepping in, look to see if they can push this back above the 10-day moving average and over $232. That opens the door the 161.8% extension near $235. From there, who knows, perhaps $250-plus is in play. On the downside, however, a break of Friday\u2019s low \u2014 also putting shares below the 21-day moving average \u2014 puts the $216 to $218 zone on the table. That puts Honeywell back into the prior breakout level, uptrend support and the 10-week and 50-day moving averages. 7 Big Data Stocks Supporting All Aspects of Life I would expect a bounce from this area should we get there. Top Trades for Monday No. 4: Inovio Pharmaceuticals (INO) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Inovio Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:INO) puked all over the rug this morning, and a hangover on Monday is possible. On Wednesday and Thursday, INO stock was perking up as it tried to break out of its downtrend. However, the 10-week moving average rejected it yesterday and today it plunged. Shares burst below critical support between $8.25 and $8.75. While it\u2019s bouncing from Friday\u2019s low, keep these areas in mind. That is, the prior support zone and Friday\u2019s low. A break of Friday\u2019s low could put lower prices in play. A rally back to prior support needs to be reclaimed if bulls want to regain control. Look for this telling signal: Does prior support become resistance?

The S&P 500 Index (SPX) closed just above 4185 a week ago and finished Thursday near 4135, so it would take a major rally for a green week after the taxman\u2019s visit yesterday. At the same time, there aren\u2019t a lot of new catalysts at work. Friday isn\u2019t the busiest earnings day of the season, but it\u2019s just the calm before the storm. Next week is when the floodgates open and more than 100 S&P 500 companies report, including four of the five \u201cFAANG\u201d companies along with Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). More on that below. By this time a week from now, we should have a much better sense of whether analysts\u2019 average estimate for 24% Q1 earnings growth is in the ballpark or needs adjustment. Despite Signs Of Rebound, Caution Still In Place Yesterday was a rough day thanks in part to new reminders of possible higher taxes (see more below). The Tech sector, especially semiconductors, took a licking, with those shares giving up a lot of Wednesday\u2019s gains. The so-called \u201chorsemen of risk\u201d were in the saddle as bonds and volatility galloped higher. Volatility eased a little this morning, but bonds continued climbing and the 10-year Treasury yield fell below 1.55%\u2014near the bottom of its recent range. It\u2019s been a slow data week, and today ends without many fireworks. The new home sales report for March is about the only big data point today, and analysts expect a steep climb to 912,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis from 775,000 a month earlier, according to research firm Briefing.com. Earnings-wise, companies are getting punished this morning. American Express (NYSE: AXP) and Honeywell (NYSE: HON) are both lower in pre-market trading. The pressure on HON appeared related to disappointment in its aerospace results, which missed the Street\u2019s views. AXP share\u2019s early softness is a classic case of what we\u2019ve been talking about this earnings season: Don\u2019t miss on revenue. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) shares also lost ground after reporting last night. The semiconductor firm may be getting a fish eye from investors because the company faces big costs to build new factories, which could potentially eat into margins. Having said that, it\u2019s never a bad thing to see a company investing for its future, especially one like INTC which faces such heavy competition. One thing that stood out was INTC\u2019s CEO saying the chip shortage could last at least two more years. Think about how that could affect automakers and everyone else. It\u2019s something to keep an eye on, because chips are used everywhere. Snap (NYSE: SNAP) had a very nice quarter. They lost money, but less than expected, revenue was solid, and user numbers looked good. The stock fell at first in pre-market trading, but then hustled back higher. One sector that performed pretty badly Thursday was Materials. Caught in the middle was Dow Inc. (DOW), whose earnings and revenue Thursday exceeded analyst expectations amid what analysts see as strong demand for its chemicals. If you\u2019re an executive at DOW, you\u2019re probably wondering what you have to do to impress Wall Street, considering the company\u2019s guidance also topped consensus views. Barron\u2019s called the selling \u201ca head-scratcher\u201d after a \u201cblockbuster report.\u201d Hard to argue with that. Maybe you\u2019re wondering why it\u2019s so hard for stocks to go up despite decent earnings this quarter. Well, when you\u2019re near all-time highs, it\u2019s hard to get rewarded. It\u2019s not like people are necessarily looking for a reason to buy more stock, especially stocks that have had incredible runs lately. \u201cRead My Lips:\u201d New Tax Proposal Hits Market This isn\u2019t a political column, but sometimes Washington makes it hard not to talk politics in this space. We\u2019re at one of those points after yesterday\u2019s Bloomberg report about the Biden administration possibly planning to raise capital gains taxes and tax rates on high earners. As you probably know by now, the news outlet reported that the Biden administration would increase the rate for the richest Americans to 39.6%, from 37%, percent, while raising the capital gains tax on people earning more than $1 million to 39.6%, from 20%. Stocks immediately took a clobbering on the news. We\u2019re not going to venture an opinion on the proposals themselves. But you can\u2019t help but think that some investors might see the news as a sell signal and try to exit positions ahead of any new taxes coming down from the Beltway. That\u2019s just what tends to happen when there\u2019s news like this. If you\u2019re an investor and had plans to sell anyway, maybe it just puts more oil on the fire to get it done. However, if you\u2019re in the market for the long-term, a new tax proposal or two shouldn\u2019t necessarily affect your day-to-day planning. For one thing, there\u2019s absolutely no certainty that Congress has the ability to pass this proposal. For another thing, tax rates tend to change a lot over time, depending on the administration. It\u2019s like the weather in Chicago: If you don\u2019t like it now, wait a few minutes. While selling definitely picked up yesterday on the tax news, it\u2019s really nothing all that new when you think about it, Briefing.com pointed out. After all, President Biden campaigned on higher taxes for the wealthy. So Thursday\u2019s sell-off might have been one of those times when people were looking for excuses to book some profit and chose that one. Overall, the Materials, Energy, Consumer Discretionary, and Info Tech sectors were hardest hit by selling yesterday. Not a single S&P 500 sector finished in the green. If stocks keep getting pounded today, a possible technical support point might be near the 50-day moving average for the S&P 500 Index (SPX), now at 3970. A drop below that might cause technical selling to pick up. Crude Choppy, Crypto Chopped Crude\u2019s had an odd week. It\u2019s chopped up and down and at one point fell below $60 a barrel amid worries about demand from India and other parts of Asia where Covid cases are up. Since reaching $60 a barrel for the first time post-Covid in mid-February, the crude front-month has been surprisingly stable. It hasn\u2019t fallen much below $60 or risen much above $65 over these two months. If you watch crude over time, you\u2019ll see it often carves a trading range and stays there for a while. It would probably take a move above the 2021 high of $67.98 or a drop below the March low of $57.25 to upset the apple cart much in this market. It\u2019s also been an odd week for Bitcoin. Well, maybe odd isn\u2019t the right word. It\u2019s just getting hammered, and fell below $50,000. That\u2019s after piercing $60,000 for the first time not long ago. One possible reason for the weakness could be worry about how any new tax proposal could affect profits from trading in cryptocurrencies. Remember, that\u2019s still pretty unclear, and remains in the realm of speculation for now. Also, maybe it\u2019s worth noting that the last time the capital gains tax went up (in 2013), the SPX rose 30%. CHART OF THE DAY: BUILDING UP.

Broken Record Department: You\u2019ve heard it here before and you\u2019ll hear it again: Earnings drive the market. This may sound like the record is skipping, but it\u2019s true. And if you\u2019re only going to focus on earnings one week out of the quarter, make it this coming week or you\u2019ll miss the top-40 countdown. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are just a few of the big names stepping onto the earnings stage after this weekend. One thing they all have in common, obviously, is exposure to the Tech sector, even if AMZN, GOOGL, and TSLA aren\u2019t officially \u201cTech\u201d stocks. Together, these stocks make up 80% of the so-called \u201cFAANGs,\u201d and MSFT is often thought of as a FAANG cousin who might fit on the list if it\u2019s name didn\u2019t start with a letter that would mess up the cool word. You\u2019re also talking almost $9 trillion in market cap spread across those six stocks. Together, they make up more than a quarter of the S&P 500\u2019s market capitalization, and how they do can really make or break an earnings season. We\u2019ve already previewed GOOGL\u2019s earnings\u2014where advertising revenue and cloud technology are likely to be in focus\u2014and FB, which has seen solid ad revenue growth but may have a couple headwinds ahead. Stay tuned for previews of AAPL, TSLA, and AMZN. Refi High: Speaking of broken records, here\u2019s an oldie but a goodie: with interest rates heading back down after last month\u2019s spike, mortgage applications\u2014and specifically mortgage refinances\u2014are back on the front burner, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). Overall mortgage activity was up 8.6% on the week last week, but refi applications were up 10%, and as of last week make up 60% of all applications. According to Bankrate\u2019s weekly survey, average rates for a 30-year fixed mortgage ticked down six basis points to 3.21% (but still 30 basis points higher than the record low set in January). In and of itself, refis are a good thing for the consumer economy, as they tend to lower a fixed line item in the budget, thus leaving more room for discretionary spending, like home renovations, for example. Where it gets tricky, however, is when refinancers take cash out of their homes (the \u201ccash-out refi\u201d that hit fever pitch just before the financial crisis in 2008). According to Freddie Mac, borrowers cashed out about $48 billion in refis in Q4 2020\u2014the highest level since late 2008. When you look at the trends in housing and commodity prices (see chart above), it\u2019s tempting to conclude we\u2019re setting up for another bruising pullback. But the housing market is fundamentally different than it was in 2008. And considering how unprecedented the pandemic has been, it\u2019s probably folly to compare anything to 2020 and draw conclusions. An Abundance Of You Know What: Before the tax worries cratered Wall Street yesterday, it had been a pretty nice broad-based rally at midweek, if you take the steep Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) losses out of the equation. Still, the better performing sectors over the last week have still been defensive ones like Utilities, Health Care and Real Estate. Plus you have the bond market making some gains and volatility edging higher. Caution seems to be the watchword. That being said, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) couldn\u2019t take out 20 on Thursday and the 10-year yield stayed above its recent 1.52% low. Those could be reckoning points to watch today and next week for hints at the market\u2019s next move. TD Ameritrade\u00ae commentary for educational purposes only. Member SIPC.
