We're proud to collaborate with our hometown customer and other partners around the world this year to make flying more sustainable,\" said Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal.\n\nBoeing's ecoDemonstrator program has led to the development and testing of more than 200 promising technologies since 2012. Most of the innovations have helped address the aviation industry\u2019s challenges and enhanced passengers' flight experiences.\n\nSome of the technologies developed as part of the ecoDemonstrator have been integrated into Boeing airplanes. One of the technologies, the Advanced Technology winglets, which reduce fuel use and emissions, are integrated into the 737 Max planes.\n\nYesterday, Morgan Stanley analyst Kristine Liwag reiterated a Buy rating on the stock. According to the analyst, Boeing is working on a new aircraft program that should help strengthen its competitive edge against the Airbus A321XLR. While a new aircraft program could add significant risk, the analyst believes a positive COVID-19 recovery trade will help offset any headwinds.\n\nThe analyst has a $274 price target on the stock implying 9.46% upside potential to current levels.\n\nConsensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 8 Buys and 6 Holds. The average analyst price target of $273.93 implies 9.43% upside potential to current levels.\n\nBA scores a 7 out of 10 on TipRanks' Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.\n\n\n\nRelated News:\nAccenture Expands in Southeast Asia with Entropia Buyout\nAmazon Deepens Ties with Casino Group to Enhance Food E-Commerce in France\nTyler Technologies to Snap up VendEngine for $84M; Street Says Buy", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=968e804fe7155bf0fd55bc8605107f970168e7c76d6e3656fd262d2537dcb90e"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1622739600, "headline": "Boeing and Alaska Airlines Partner to Make Flying Safer and More Sustainable", "id": 68040357, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/I3u4MAAWh1So5E6tXL2_Ig--~B/aD0yNjc7dz00MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/prnewswire.com/e824ccdff0372c944c4a8e66e0d7778f", "related": "ALK", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "Boeing [NYSE:BA] and Alaska Airlines [NYSE:ALK] announced today they are partnering on the latest Boeing ecoDemonstrator program and will flight test about 20 technologies on a new 737-9 to enhance the safety and sustainability of air travel.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=84678a5f4ce0dcd02318cf3a84cd98ecaa759da27f25f1cff0cc8ad83de70771"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1622738100, "headline": "Alaska Air Group Inc. stock outperforms competitors despite losses on the day", "id": 67986664, "image": "https://images.mktw.net/im-220105/social", "related": "ALK", "source": "MarketWatch", "summary": "Shares of Alaska Air Group Inc. shed 3.51% to $65.46 Thursday, on what proved to be an all-around dismal trading session for the stock market, with the S&P...", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b92ca7820fdbab28984e75967ae5c5c591636aaee62b64fe872a5d275ab1fd5b"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1622732222, "headline": "Alaska Air (ALK) Proposes Plans to Expand Footprint to Belize", "id": 68102459, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oiYF3bnCg2GIqNfWSLSaBA--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MzU7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/zacks.com/f649e2d32d9da440da8469f35663cbbf", "related": "ALK", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "Alaska Air (ALK) aims to add two new routes from Los Angeles and Seattle to Belize City, starting Nov 19.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=6cf242404f8ef35171d8e5837e4e823833638caed3e6add32554dc36adcadc97"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1622721600, "headline": "Alaska Airlines to resume full schedule at Paine Field by spring 2022", "id": 68102461, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lSZa2Dy_ju_A.9sqMhl1dw--~B/aD00MDA7dz00MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/prnewswire.com/d5a757dbf8f7f5c7a46a8181589bb460", "related": "ALK", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "With increasing confidence that air travel is on a steady climb to return to pre-pandemic levels in the coming year, Alaska Airlines is planning to resume our full schedule of 18 daily nonstop departures at Paine Field-Snohomish County Airport by spring 2022, possibly earlier.

(See ALK stock analysis on TipRanks)For December, Alaska Air expects cash burn between $125 million and $150 million assuming the demand remains soft as renewed restrictions are anticipated to continue through year end. The company projects December ASM to decline 40% on a year-over-year basis and revenue is likely to shrink in the range of 65%-70%.In the SEC filing, Alaska Air said, \u201cThe public health and economic crises resulting from the outbreak of COVID-19 has had an unprecedented impact on our business. We are uncertain what shape the recovery will take, and we are continuously monitoring trends in demand to determine our capacity decisions as the situation unfolds. At this time we expect fourth quarter capacity will be down approximately 40%.\u201dOn Dec. 11, Deutsche Bank analyst\u00a0Michael Linenberg\u00a0downgraded the stock to Hold from Buy saying that airline stocks are fairly valued based on 2022 valuations and investors have already paid for two years of earnings growth.
