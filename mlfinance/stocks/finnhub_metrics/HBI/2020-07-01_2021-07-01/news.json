That\u2019s one way to explain the 22% gain in Hanesbrands (HBI) stock after it reported fourth quarter earnings on February 9.This is not to say that the report wasn\u2019t good. The company, known for its comfort apparel, delivered a comfortable beat on both the top and bottom lines.With regards to revenue, Hanesbrands posted $1.8 billion, which surpassed expectations of $1.64 billion. And on the all-important bottom line, HBI delivered EPS of 38 cents, topping analysts\u2019 projections of 29 cents. This also marks the third quarter, out of the last four, in which Hanesbrands beat earnings estimates.On top of this, Hanes announced it was paying its quarterly dividend of 15 cents on March 9, 2021. While that is not an increase, it\u2019s worth noting that the company has retained its dividend throughout the pandemic.Hanes also delivered forward guidance, part of which was to say that personal protective equipment (PPE) would no longer be part of its growth plan. PPE made up a significant portion of the company\u2019s revenue in 2020.Management indicated that full-year guidance would be announced at its investor event in May. At this time, it offered a bullish first quarter outlook.For Q1, management expects net sales to be between $1.48 to $1.51 billion. The midpoint of this guidance would represent 14% year-over-year growth. Meanwhile, adjusted operating profit is forecasted to land within the range of $150 to $160 million, partly due to an offset of last year\u2019s manufacturing volume declines at the onset of the pandemic. Adjusted EPS could come in at 24 cents to 27 cents, which is well above the consensus estimate of 16 cents.Priced for Perfection?By virtually any measure, Hanesbrands delivered a stellar earnings report. However, HBI stock closed at $19.96 on Feb. 9, suggesting that investors are pricing in its full potential. That would fit in nicely with the company\u2019s Full Potential plan to grow its business.The Full Potential plan, as outlined by CEO Gerald Evans, has four pillars: building on the strength of the company\u2019s Champion brand; retaining momentum for its innerwear category; strengthening its e-commerce presence and streamlining its global portfolio.As Evans delivered his remarks, it was clear that the plan amounts to a common sense approach to reconfigure the Hanesbrands portfolio to focus on the key sales drivers. And no retail company is going to survive in 2021 without a strong e-commerce presence. Hanes did realize stronger digital sales during the pandemic and Evans noted that the company wants to build on that customer loyalty and ensure that the brand becomes sticky in a competitive space.Now, however, Hanes must execute on the plan. Although they get high marks for providing bold first quarter guidance, as other companies may shy away from putting a target on their backs, that doesn\u2019t mean the stock is not overvalued at its current price.Analysts Weigh InTurning now to the analyst community, HBI\u2019s Moderate Buy consensus rating breaks down into 1 Buy and 3 Holds. Given its average analyst price target of $17.25, shares could decline 13.6% in the year ahead. (See Hanesbrands stock analysis on TipRanks)Wait for a Better Entry PointHBI is trading at a level that hasn\u2019t been seen in over two years. And prior to the pandemic, the stock had been on a slow decline. Investors that are looking for momentum may find this to be an interesting trade.That said, investors looking for capital growth over the long haul may be disappointed. However, if the stock tracks down to around $16, it could reflect a good buying opportunity.Disclosure: On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

We\u2019re in the midst, now, of just such a rising tide \u2013 at least for the short term. The main indexes, the Dow, the S&P, and the NASDAQ, are all up between 9% and 12.5% this month, and the trends are positive. The recent election, making clear the prospect of a divided government unlikely to pass radical changes in economic policy, and positive COVID-19 vaccine news, have improved investor sentiment. And not just investors. Corporate insiders are buying up stocks, as well, in a show of confidence that should attract investors\u2019 attention. These insiders are not just buyers when it comes to stocks \u2013 they are also custodians. The insiders are corporate officers and board members, responsible for maintaining the profitability of their companies, and their companies\u2019 stocks, for the benefit of the shareholders. In addition, their positions give them access to information that is not always available to the general public. In short, following the corporate insiders is a viable path toward profitable stock moves.To make that search easier, the\u00a0TipRanks Insiders\u2019 Hot Stocks tool\u00a0gets the footwork started \u2013 identifying stocks that have seen informative moves by insiders, highlighting several common strategies used by the insiders, and collecting the data all in one place.Fresh from that database, here are the details on three \"Strong Buy\" stocks showing \u2018informative buys\u2019 in recent days.Hanesbrands (HBI)Hanesbrands is undoubtedly one you are familiar with. Hanes is a clothing manufacturer, specializing in undergarments, whose brands includes Hanes, Playtex, L\u2019eggs, Champion, and plenty more. The company\u2019s garments are somewhat ubiquitous, reflecting their necessity, and these modest products brought in over $7 billion in revenue last year.This year, Hanes, like much of the retail world, took a hit in the first quarter when the corona pandemic forced a general economic shutdown. But the company quickly rebounded, and the Q3 revenues, at $1.81 billion, were the highest of the last four quarters. Earnings show a more mixed picture; Q2 EPS came in at an excellent 60 cents, while Q3 showed a 30% drop to 42 cents. That drop, however, still left the Q3 earnings in line with previous years\u2019 results.The earnings report, with its combination of beating the estimate while falling year-over-year, pushed the stock down in recent sessions. Even so, HBI has clearly recovered its value since hitting bottom in the \u2018corona recession.\u2019 The stock is up ~90% from its low point this year. Adding to the attraction, Hanes has kept up its regular stock dividend, maintaining the payout at 15 cents per common share, for all of 2020. That dividend is now yielding an above-average 4.6%.On the insider front, two transactions, both by Ronal Nelson of the Board of Directors, have swung the sentiment needle on Hanes well into positive territory. In the last five days, Nelson has purchased over $1 million worth of shares, in two tranches, one of 50,000 shares and the other of 30,000.Covering Hanesbrands for Raymond James, analyst Matthew McClintock notes the company\u2019s strong current position. \"We believe that HBI's 3Q20 results signal a continuation of market share gains in its core categories driven by the company's inherent competitive advantages of scale, strong brands, and in-house supply chain,\u201d the 5-star analyst noted.  In addition, McClintock believes the company demonstrates its ability to adapt to the coronavirus scene: \u201cHBI's protective garment businesses is expected to slow meaningfully going forward. This recently developed business line to help fight the pandemic generated $179 million in revenues during 3Q20 (reflecting 10% of revenues) \u2014 surpassing HBI's previous 2H20 outlook of $150 million.\u201dMcClintock rates HBI a Strong Buy, and his $16 price target suggests it has a 22% upside from current levels. (To watch McClintock\u2019s track record, click here)Other analysts are on the same page. With 4 Buys and 1 Hold received in the last three months, the word on the Street is that HBI is a Strong Buy. (See HBI stock analysis on TipRanks)Dun & Bradstreet Holdings (DNB)The next stock is a newcomer to the markets. Dun & Bradstreet is a data analytics company, with a focus on business needs and services. The company, frequently known as D&B, offers data services in risk and finance, ops and supply, sales and marketing, and research and insight. D&B has a global reach, and this past summer, 171 years after its founding, it held its IPO.That IPO raised an impressive $1.7 billion in new capital \u2013 and sold more shares than expected, at a higher price than forecast. After initially pricing 65.75 million shares at $19 to $21 each, the company\u2019s June IPO saw the sale of 78.3 million shares at a share price to $22. Since then, the stock is up ~30%. Revenues are strong, too. For the calendar Q3, the company\u2019s first in public trading, the top line hit $442 million, its highest level in over a year.All of this could explain the strongly positive insider sentiment. Two large buys in the past week are flashing signals for investors. Bryan Hipsher, company CFO, purchased over $105,000 worth, while CEO Anthony Jabbour spent $999,780 on a bloc of 38,000 shares. The two sales together total over $1.1 million.RBC analyst Seth Weber, rated 5-stars by TipRanks, is bullish on DNB. He rates the stock Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with a $31 price target. (To watch Weber\u2019s track record, click here)In his comments, Weber says, \u201cWe see D&B's ongoing transformation as intact, supporting more consistent rev growth, margin expansion and better cash generation\u2026 On the tech side, the cloud based Analytics Studio is ramping, and initial functionality from Project Ascent is expected in 4Q20 (improve data ingestion, reduced latency); the company continues to add new/alt data sources and coverage.\u201dD&B shares are currently trading for $27.40, and its $31.67 average price target is slightly more bullish than Weber\u2019s, implying a 15% upside for the coming year. The analyst consensus rating, a Strong Buy, is based on a unanimous 3 Buy reviews. (See DNB stock analysis on TipRanks)Assurant (AIZ)Last but not least is Assurant, niche player in the insurance industry. Assurant provides insurance products and solutions for a variety of needs, including connected devices, vehicles, rental units, funerals, and consumer goods. Some of these are traditional insurance products (vehicles come to mind here), while others are good examples of a company spotting an unfilled need \u2013 and moving to fill it (connected devices and rental units). Assurant\u2019s shares and fiscal results this year have been solid. The stock has fully recovered from the COVID hit, and now shows a real, if modest, year-to-date gain of 5.5%. At the top line, revenues have remained firmly between $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion for the past 12 months; the Q3 number, at $2.5 billion, is smack in the middle of that range. The only dark spot is EPS, which slipped in Q3 to $1.41, a sequential drop of 48%.The drop didn't bother Braxton Carter, the company's board member, too much. Carter bought a bloc of 1,950 shares on November 6, paying over $249,000. Covering the stock for Truist, 5-star analyst Mark Hughes points out the company\u2019s strength in the underappreciated rental insurance market. \u201cThe company has renewed 85% of its US customers in Lender-placed since the start of last year. They are not yet seeing any uptick in placements from the surge in mortgage delinquencies, but suggested there could be incremental volume in 2021 depending on the state of the housing market. The acceleration in Multi-family revenue growth, to 9% in the third quarter, was attributed in part to the momentum with the Cover360 property management product,\u201d Hughes noted. In analyst concluded, \u201cAssurant has had success in operating in parts of the insurance industry that are much less-traveled than most - particularly in the controversial and volatile, but very profitable, lender-placed homeowners insurance market.\u201d To this end, Hughes rates AIZ a Buy, along with a $150 price target. This figure implies a 10% upside from current levels. (To watch Hughes\u2019 track record, click here)All in all, with 3 Buy reviews on record, the Strong Buy analyst consensus rating on Assurant is unanimous. The stock\u2019s average price target, of $149.67, is in line with Hughes\u2019, and suggests a one-year upside potential of ~10%.

Even excluding the C9 brand, which Target Corp. stopped selling in January, activewear sales declined 27% in its home market.While the Champion brand specifically saw improvements from the prior quarter, it wasn\u2019t enough to offset the slump. Hanes is now launching an \u201cin-depth business review\u201d to prepare a long-term growth strategy, the company said.\u201cWith respect to the scope of the strategic assessment, we are evaluating our entire global portfolio,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Stephen Bratspies said on the company\u2019s earnings call, his first since joining the apparel maker in August.He said the review will look at everything from historical performance and costs to the supply chain and organizational structure. It will also examine product quality, direct-to-consumer capabilities and how the brand is perceived by the retailers who sell it.\u201cIn an environment where the pace of change is accelerating, for us to be successful and reach our full potential, we must become a more agile, consumer-centric, growth-oriented company,\u201d he said on the call, adding that the review -- which already started on the cost-structure side -- will last several years.The review comes at a time when Hanesbrands sales are lagging, even as American consumers are largely leaning into comfortable at-home work attire. The company also owns apparel brands including Maidenform, Playtex and L\u2019eggs. Even though Champion is still appealing to younger consumers, some of its other brands are \u201caging a little bit,\u201d the CEO said, citing a need to reach a new demographic.The Hanes report is another sign of trouble in the apparel market. Rival Columbia Sportswear Co. missed analysts\u2019 estimates for sales and profit last week.Hanesbrands will be boosting its advertising spend and also considering M&A where it makes sense. Going forward, Champion should see sequential sales growth in the fourth quarter, while its stronger innerwear segment will log another period of year-on-year gains, it said.Shares, which were up 10% this year through Wednesday, erased the year\u2019s gains on Thursday.
