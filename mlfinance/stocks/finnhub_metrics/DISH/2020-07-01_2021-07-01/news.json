According to Reuters, the company will launch its first 5G service as early as next year in Las Vegas, Nevada. (See Dish stock chart on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nUnlike other carriers that are simply upgrading their networks, Dish faces an uphill task as it builds its 5G infrastructure from scratch. Rather than buy all the gear it needs to support the network, the company will leverage the Open Radio Access Network (O-Ran). Dish uses software to run functions on standardized computer hardware. (See Dell stock charts on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nThe use of O-RAN will allow Dish to mix hardware and services from different vendors instead of relying on one vendor, such as Nokia (NOK).\n\n\n\n\"We can put the servers at the bottom of the tower, or we can centralize 10, 15 or 50 sites \u2026 The beauty of this edge cloud is the software can be placed where we want it,\" said Dish's executive Marc Rouanne.\n\n\n\nPivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak has upgraded the stock to a Buy from a Hold and increased the price target to $60.00 from $50, implying 45.5% upside potential to current levels. According to the analyst, the price target is conservative, given Dish's prospects around the 5G network.\n\n\n\nWlodarczak\u00a0 stated, \u201cDISH is in the process of rolling out what we view as a revolutionary cloud-native/software-driven 5G network with key partner AWS (AMZN, N/R) that should allow them/developers/AWS to relatively quickly develop 5G applications/services that have the potential to revolutionize wireless, particularly in enterprise market.\"\n\n\n\nConsensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 5 Buys, 3 Holds, and 2 Sells. The average analyst Dish price target of $49.22 implies 19.38% upside potential to current levels.\n\n\n\nDISH scores 4 out of 10 on TipRanks' Smart Score rating system, suggesting that the stock is likely to perform in line with market averages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated News:Trimble to Sell Iron Solutions Unit to Randall-Reilly; Street Says BuyExtended Stay America Acquired by Blackstone and Starwood Capital Group for $6BGoogle Opens First Physical Store in New York City", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c59a463406827df2d355d4ea332f62306612627d180335a25f07ac3a290d1795"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1623915597, "headline": "Stocks making the biggest moves in the premarket: CureVac, The Honest Company, Fisker & more", "id": 68324084, "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106663674-1597404572464-2020-08-14T104458Z_1_LYNXNPEG7D0Q7_RTROPTP_4_GSK-CUREVAC-STAKE.JPG?v=1597404636", "related": "DISH", "source": "CNBC", "summary": "The stocks making the biggest moves in premarket trading include CureVac, The Honest Company, Fisker, and more.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=00488850fac521e9a1f39834cec98ac07e0d092c155e6bfd08484d240b30a980"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1623914700, "headline": "Dish, Dell To Collaborate Over US 5G Network Building: Reuters", "id": 68338178, "image": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/og_image_social_share_1200x630/images/story/2012/abtech_691.png", "related": "DISH", "source": "Benzinga", "summary": "DISH Network Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ: DISH) will collaborate with\u00a0Dell Technologies Inc\u00a0(NYSE: DELL) for critical parts of the new 5G network building in the U.S.,\u00a0...", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ca43e2f02b502902368bcdd055c9c9e6da86f8c80e8e7b1fcab32de85dc123d8"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1623888060, "headline": "Dish Network taps Dell for 5G network infrastructure", "id": 68362699, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2021-06-17T042733Z_1_UF7_RTRLXPP_2_LYNXPACKAGER.JPG?2133665133", "related": "DISH", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "Dish Network will tap Dell Technologies Inc for key parts of the new 5G network it is building in the United States, the companies said on Thursday.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=1f57b44508f2934c426da35d20bd6c8ec9e8dc819bb57bcf9ce90f3f44a58548"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1623847585, "headline": "Dish could become 'best positioned 5G operator to actually fulfill the promise of 5G,' analyst says in upgrade", "id": 68299671, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/S8SCotpO9m2XQyQUIGU5dw--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/marketwatch.com/96d076434b2a015a3010bd2787b8c856", "related": "DISH", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "Shares of Dish Network Corp. are up 2.6% in premarket trading Wednesday after Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak upgraded the stock to buy from hold and boosted his target price to $60 from $50.

Per the terms of the deal, AWS will act as DISH\u2019s preferred cloud provider and DISH will build its 5G network on AWS. Furthermore, both companies will jointly work to transform how organizations and customers, including AWS and Amazon (AMZN), order and consume 5G services or create their own private 5G networks, the company said. Notably, DISH (DISH) plans to deploy its first standalone, cloud-based 5G Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) in the US, starting with Las Vegas later in 2021. AWS\u2019s well-established infrastructure and wide range of services will aid DISH in deploying a cloud-native 5G network. It should be noted that the 5G network incorporates O-RAN, the antennas and base stations, which link phones and other wireless devices to the network, and the 5G Core, which directs traffic flow within the network. Additionally, DISH\u2019s fully automated Operation and Business Support Systems (OSS and BSS) will also be enhanced, which will help the company in provisioning and operating its customers\u2019 5G workloads and monetizing its network. (See Amazon stock analysis on TipRanks) Through the DISH network on AWS, the process of creating new 5G applications will be simplified. What\u2019s more, developers of both DISH and AWS will be able to create innovative 5G solutions for various industries through leveraging standardized application programming interfaces (APIs), which will connect with data on DISH network attributes. AWS CEO Andy Jassy said, \u201cDISH\u2019s cloud-native and truly virtualized 5G network is a clear example of how AWS customers can use our proven infrastructure and unparalleled portfolio of services to reinvent industries. This collaboration means DISH and its customers can bring new consumer- and enterprise-centric services to the market as quickly as they\u2019re created to deliver on the promise of 5G. Together, we\u2019re opening the door to new technologies that will transform factories, workplaces, entertainment, and transportation in ways people have only dreamed.\u201d On April 21, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein reiterated a Buy rating and increased the price target to $4,200 (24.9% upside potential) from $4,100, as he sees AMZN as the firm\u2019s \u201cbest large-cap pick.\u201d Helfstein said, \u201cWe are raising our AWS revenue estimates ahead of 1Q results. Our non-AWS estimates remain unchanged. Post 1Q earnings focus will continue to be on AMZN\u2019s investment plans, as it recorded $11B in one-time COVID-19-related costs in 2020. We expect funds to be redeployed to expand grocery, pharmacy, and advertising.\u201d The consensus rating is a Strong Buy based on 32 unanimous Buys. The average analyst price target stands at $4,106.60 and implies upside potential of 22.2% to current levels. Shares have gained 42.3% over the past year. On top of this, Amazon scores an 8 out of 10 from TipRanks\u2019 Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

(AWS) as its preferred cloud provider and will construct its 5G network on AWS under Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) deal. Dish will launch its 5G network in Las Vegas in the third quarter, as per the Financial Times report. The public cloud shift and the use of smaller suppliers, called \u2018Open RAN\u2019, were vital to regaining a footing in the global telecoms market following the regulatory crackdowns on Huawei Technologies\u2019 equipment use in markets including the U.S. and U.K., Dish Chair Charlie Ergen said. Dish utilized capacity on T-Mobile U.S. Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ: TMUS) 4G services network. It has planned to incur $8 billion to $10 billion on its 5G network build-up. The company has also expended $25 billion on the spectrum. Dish\u2019s licenses mandated it to connect 20% of the U.S. population to the 5G network by June next year. Amazon won the Dish deal by beating the likes of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google, Ergen said. The telecom industry attracted large U.S. technology companies in the past two years following the shift in telecom functions to the cloud. Amazon\u2019s upcoming CEO Andy Jassy expected more telecom companies to follow Dish\u2019s example over the coming years to focus their limited resources on network expansion and customer services instead of in-house data centers. The \u201cexpensive and slower\u201d current network architecture drove the 5G shift added Jassy. Amazon failed to enter the mobile handset market and is estimated to launch its wireless brand recently. Amazon aimed to partner with the telecoms industry via AWS, as 5G and edge computing drove the need for processing power across the mobile network, according to Jassy. Disruptive Analysis founder Dean Bubley expected the broader telecom sector shift to the public cloud to occur \u201cin stages\u201d as some parts of a network could not be \u201ccloudified.\u201d Dish is betting on the AWS deal to compete with Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE: VZ), AT&T Inc (NYSE: T), and T-Mobile U.S. Inc.

No financial terms were given.The agreement is a crucial piece of Dish\u2019s 5G strategy and comes nearly four years after Chairman Charlie Ergen said he was seeking a key partner that shared his vision of putting the company\u2019s treasure trove of airwaves to use in a futuristic wireless network. Dish, a pay-TV provider with 11.3 million subscribers, is spending $10 billion to transform itself into a cloud-based wireless carrier to challenge giants like AT&T.Shares of Dish rose as much as 4.4% to $39.61 Wednesday in New York, a 52-week high and their biggest intraday gain since December. New State Research called the deal \u201ca \u2018foot-in-the-door\u2019 with a critical partner that provides strong validation of the opportunity ahead for Dish.\u201dDish has the fourth-largest holding of wireless airwaves in the U.S., but almost none of it is in service yet. By using a so-called cloud-native network, Dish will be able to nimbly scale capacity up and down, depending on traffic, and deliver a range of applications, from heavy-data processing for businesses to simple texts to consumer phones.Later Start\u201cWe definitely share the same vision with AWS,\u201d said Marc Rouanne, Dish\u2019s chief network officer.Dish is entering the 5G race behind T-Mobile US Inc., Verizon and AT&T, which already offer the service. But there are still very few 5G users, applications or revenue, suggesting the market remains wide open. Promoters of 5G services say they will enable innovations like immersive gaming and self-driving vehicles.AWS will serve as the core of Dish\u2019s network, allowing the upstart 5G provider to outsource its data operations in much the same way other businesses have turned to outside IT and cloud-services providers for data management. For Englewood, Colorado-based Dish, this means that mobile traffic picked up by a tower antenna will be immediately connected to the AWS cloud.While AWS has tinkered in wireless, including a 5G edge-computing partnership with Verizon, this move with Dish is the first attempt to replicate core elements of a telecommunications network in the cloud.AWS, the largest seller of cloud-computing services, has worked in recent years to make its products more valuable to customers in potentially lucrative fields like telecommunications, health care and defense. The division had $45.4 billion in revenue last year.\u201cA cloud partner like Amazon a gives us a low starting cost,\u201d Rouanne said. Unlike the massive hardware and network-operation expenses of traditional carrier networks, \u201cwe will connect devices in a very cost-effective manner. This will make a big difference in the market.\u201d(Updates shares in fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=20d5b922c649380be9ff4f0aa22946d4cbb1b759fdd8795862e7a80bde43b8bc"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619019086, "headline": "Dish stock jumps after company announces Amazon cloud deal for 5G buildout", "id": 66207447, "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/102539609-1564165040093preview.jpg?v=1619031732", "related": "DISH", "source": "CNBC", "summary": "The tie-up with Amazon could help Dish quickly establish a foothold in 5G as consumers begin to travel again.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a14ad0e17089b07d9e9a883e29b54ff90f62325f0c28784fb6453e1006c8cb8e"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619010000, "headline": "DISH and AWS Form Strategic Collaboration to Reinvent 5G Connectivity and Innovation", "id": 66423198, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9BU502nE3p2mPwzgyb57uA--~B/aD05ODt3PTQ4MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/business-wire.com/ced1ab212efc51ce1a80a71c4840a338", "related": "DISH", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "Today, Amazon Web Services, Inc.

On Dec. 24 announced a multi-year carriage agreement with Nexstar Media Group.The agreement provides Dish (DISH) TV subscribers with a countrywide facility to tune in to Nexstar-owned programming, including news, entertainment and sports. Shares declined 1.4% at after-hours trading on Thursday.Under the terms of the agreement, local stations and WGN America were immediately reinstated on Dish TV. Additionally, WGN America will be available on SLING TV in early 2021 as part of an extra add-on package.The agreement was forged after Nexstar Media cut off local programming for nearly 5.4 million Dish subscribers on Dec. 2, rejecting a request to renew the contract between the companies. Nexstar had allegedly asked Dish to pay high rates and imposed tariff increases onto customers. It allegedly demanded a hefty fee of $1 billion for stations that were available for free. Nexstar also allegedly forced Dish to add WGN America as part of the subscription, which had witnessed declining viewership in recent years.On Dec. 17, Raymond James analyst Ric Prentiss reiterated a Buy rating on the stock but lowered the price target from $58 to $55 adjusting for the $2 billion convertible note offering announced on Dec. 15 with pricing announced on Dec. 17.The offering would be utilized towards general corporate purposes including 5G network buildout costs.The new price target still implies 77% upside potential.

The net proceeds of the offering are intended to be used for general corporate purposes, including 5G network buildout costs, the company said.The offered notes will be unsecured obligations and Dish will settle any conversion in cash, shares of its Class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares. The interest rate, the initial conversion rate, and other terms and conditions of the notes will be negotiated between Dish and the initial purchaser of the notes.Earlier this year, Dish completed its $1.4 billion acquisition of wireless carrier Boost Mobile. The deal resulted from the T-Mobile-Sprint (TMUS) merger that required an agreement from Sprint to divest its subsidiary Boost Mobile.Guggenheim analyst Mike McCormack this month cut the stock\u2019s rating to Hold from Buy, casting some doubt on Dish\u2019s recent business strategy.\"While we had hoped asset value would have been realized through either a sale of spectrum, or a partnership with a deep-pocketed tech firm, those scenarios are seemingly becoming much less likely,\" McCormack wrote in a note to investors. \"In our view, attacking a wireless industry with deeply entrenched competitors with a starting point of less than 10 million prepaid subscribers and a lengthy and costly build ahead isn't a strategy we can endorse.\u201d\u201cWhile something may still materialize, we see the buildout process unfolding and do not see upside to shares as an operating company,\" the analyst summed up.

With shares up less than 1% this year, the average\u00a0price target stands at $47.67\u00a0and implies upside potential of about 34% to current levels.Related News:PTC To Snap Up Arena For $715M; Street Says BuyAlarm To Buy Shooter Detection Systems; Shares Rise 4%Segro Buys 74.9% Stake In Sofibus To Boost Paris Footprint", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=798734e1c73d22c35e0234cf949050b79de6fbbdf8ec0cf2bb5fa89e1b511c62"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1608053400, "headline": "7 Stocks Moving In Tuesday's After-Hours Session", "id": 61751048, "image": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/og_image_social_share_1200x630/sites/all/themes/bz2/images/bz-icon.png", "related": "DISH", "source": "Benzinga", "summary": "Gainers\n\nSio Gene Therapies (NASDAQ: SIOX) shares are trading higher after the company announced \"positive\" six-month follow-up data from a low-dose cohort of Phase 1/2...", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4fcfcb9a1bdcbfb18d94376e4ffe6a2c2b63c2beaadef2f8fbe55b378bbbeafd"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1608051219, "headline": "After Hours Market: Apollo Endosurgery, American Outdoor, Sio Gene Gain; Penumbra, DISH Network Slip", "id": 61751596, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?404661449", "related": "DISH", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "(RTTNews) - Apollo Endosurgery, Inc.

Decipher the announcement with Benzinga's help.Net Income, Earnings, And Earnings Per Share Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding.Earnings And Revenue DISH Network earnings will be near $0.69 per share on sales of $3.56 billion, according to analysts. DISH Network earnings in the same period a year ago was $0.66 per share. Quarterly sales came in at $3.17 billion.Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the \"consensus estimates\"; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an \"earnings surprise\", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values.View more earnings on DISHIf the company were to match the consensus estimate when it reports Friday, earnings would be up 4.55%. Revenue would be up 12.37% on a year-over-year basis. DISH Network's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past like this:Quarter Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 Q3 2019  EPS Estimate 0.58 0.57 0.59 0.61  EPS Actual 0.78 0.55 0.69 0.66  Revenue Estimate 3.10 B 3.15 B 3.15 B 3.16 B  Revenue Actual 3.19 B 3.22 B 3.24 B 3.17 B  Stock Performance Shares of DISH Network were trading at $26.51 as of November 04. Over the last 52-week period, shares are down 23.24%. Given that these returns are generally negative, long-term shareholders are probably upset going into this earnings release.Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call.

Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt DISH Network has.DISH Network's Debt Based on DISH Network's financial statement as of August 7, 2020, long-term debt is at $10.99 billion and current debt is at $2.30 billion, amounting to $13.29 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $2.59 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $10.70 billion.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering DISH Network's $33.50 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.4. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and average for another.Why Shareholders Look At Debt? Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.See more from Benzinga  * Options Trades For This Crazy Market: Get Benzinga Options to Follow High-Conviction Trade Ideas  * A Look Into Sunrun's Debt  * A Look Into Walgreens Boots Alliance's Debt(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The dividend costs 51 cents.But in a world where the 30-year government bond yields 1.4%, AT&T stock is down 6.3% from its last earnings report on July 23. This despite a yield that now totals 7.16% per year. That's higher than Chevron (NYSE:CVX).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHow can this be? AT&T is the leading provider of mobile services, a business certain to take off with 5G. It is a major provider of wired broadband as well. Its press release on earnings claimed good things are coming from its entertainment unit, WarnerMedia.What's wrong? The DebtWhat's wrong is the balance sheet, which showed over $175 billion of debt at the end of June. That's a debt to equity ratio of .96.  Forget the company's market cap of $207 billion. Its \"enterprise value,\" the debt and equity combined, is almost $400 billion.Most of the debt was bought to handle two miserable, terrible, horrible, and very bad deals by former CEO Randall Stephenson.It spent $67 billion for DirecTV, a direct-satellite broadcaster, including its debt. It's now worth much less.Goldman Sachs was hired to examine DirecTV's possible sale to private equity in May, and a sale to Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) is often teased. But nothing has happened yet. DirecTV has lost 7 million customers over the last two years and may bring much less than AT&T paid for it.Then there's WarnerMedia, for which Stephenson paid $85 billion in 2018.  AT&T has been squeezing out costs ever since then, while rivals like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have increased budgets. Many of the Warner assets, like CNN, are built for cable TV, and AT&T lost 954,000 of these customers in the second quarter alone. What WorksIt's clear that what Stephenson bought doesn't work for T stock.What does work is AT&T Wireless, which has been the company's bedrock since its 1994 acquisition of McCaw Cellular for $12.4 billion.Despite heavy advertising for 5G, AT&T has been squeezing costs here too. AT&T's capital budget is about $20 billion, and that includes AT&T fiber deployments.The AT&T capital budget is now lower than that for Amazon, which spent $24 billion over the last four quarters. Amazon is worth $1.58 trillion, or 7.6 AT&T's. Even with AT&T's debt added, Amazon is worth nearly four times more. Why Buy AT&T?There are reasons to buy AT&T, based largely on new CEO John Stankey undoing much of what Stephenson did.Take a loss on DirecTV. Sell parts of WarnerMedia, like the movie studio, to Apple, Amazon, or Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, even Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Spin-off the cable networks like CNN, as a stand-alone company, to a cloud company or through private equity.In other words, dump the garbage and focus on the network. There is enormous growth in 5G, for cars and the machine internet. Serving these last-mile networks are what's working in the 2020 economy. AT&T shareholders should be benefiting from that change, which has years of runway ahead of it.Instead, they're stuck with debt and entertainment.This is a situation that can't continue. Cloud companies need more bandwidth to keep growing. They don't need to see that bandwidth constricted because carriers are focused on TV, where bandwidth requirements are ultimately limited.You buy AT&T today for the dividend, and you wait for the reorganization. The present company doesn't work, but its pieces will work for someone. In 2023 AT&T will be a very different company. Take the yield in T stock and wait for the capital gains of a break-up that now looks inevitable.On the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn owned shares in AAPL and AMZN.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.
