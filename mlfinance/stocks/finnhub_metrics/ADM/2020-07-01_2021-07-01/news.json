Nevertheless, let\u2019s give credit where it\u2019s due. The IRS had the good sense to know that many Americans were hurting. Therefore, it decided to extend its tax filing deadline to May 17. If you\u2019re a procrastinator, you\u2019ll soon get your tax refund, which brings up the idea of best stocks to buy with it. First, let me just say the obvious. A tax refund is really just a beautiful American euphemism for giving Uncle Sam an interest-free loan. But that\u2019s the mentality that you find yourself in if you\u2019re a worker bee: You wait for that one day of the year when you get a special treat. Instead, if you were in business for yourself, you could hustle for multiple special days to buy all the best stocks. Still, working for a major corporation has its advantages, such as paid time off, health insurance and income stability, among many other benefits. Therefore, I can appreciate why many Americans eagerly wait for the \u201crefund.\u201d According to CNBC, the average refund size is a hefty $2,893. That amounts to $241 a month, money that you could have put to work through consistent contributions toward the best stocks to buy instead of loaning it to the federal government.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips It\u2019s just something to think about. Even if you don\u2019t make the leap from a W2 employee to, say, a 1099 contractor, you should consult with your professional tax or financial advisor \u2014 which is not me, to be clear \u2014 to streamline your finances in the future. You want your money to benefit you, not anyone else and certainly not a giant bureaucracy. Anyways, if you\u2019re the average tax payer, you have roughly $3,000 to play with. And if you kept some of your stimulus checks (assuming you were eligible), you have even more funds at your disposal. Here then are seven best stocks to buy with your newfound riches. The Top 7 Ways to Invest In Semiconductors Now Based on the volatile circumstances in the market, I\u2019m leaning more on the cautious side. However, on this list of stocks to buy, you\u2019ll find some speculative ideas if that\u2019s more of your flavor. McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (NASDAQ:KTOS) H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) Smith & Wesson Brands (NASDAQ:SWBI) Cinemark (NYSE:CNK) Stocks to Buy: McDonald\u2019s (MCD) Source: ATIKAN PORNCHAIPRASIT / Shutterstock.com Unsurprisingly, one of the worst-hit sectors from the novel coronavirus outbreak was the restaurant industry. Specifically, the mom-and-pops that have far fewer resources suffered immeasurably, leading to organizations starting initiatives to encourage the public to support local small businesses. While noble, I must say that from a personal perspective, I\u2019m not seeing much evidence of traction. Every time I pass by a McDonald\u2019s, I see the drive-thru packed to the hilt. Having visited McDonald\u2019s pre-pandemic to check out the company\u2019s rebranding campaign, I must say that its drive-thru lanes move very quickly. Still, it\u2019s a bit alarming that American consumers would seemingly rather support big business than small. Whatever. When it comes to seeking out the best stocks to buy, you can\u2019t rely on sentiment. Instead, the hard facts speak for themselves. In its quarter ended March 31, 2021, McDonald\u2019s generated revenue of $5.12 billion. That\u2019s up 2% from the same quarter two years ago, and just under parity from three years ago. This suggests the Golden Arches could be on the mend, which would be very good for MCD stock. Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) Source: Shutterstock.com Arguably the least exciting name on this list of best stocks to buy, I wouldn\u2019t ordinarily be so bullish on Archer Daniels Midland if indeed we were in a decidedly optimistic phase in the market. Right now, though, it seems the overriding mood is to deleverage from risk-on assets to risk-off plays. If so, I don\u2019t think you could get any more risk-off in the equities space than ADM stock. As a food-processing giant, Archer Daniels Midland represents one of the prime places to put your tax refund to work. Here\u2019s the philosophy. Just prior to the pandemic, most Americans used their refund to pay down debt. Therefore, if you\u2019re going to invest the money instead, you want to get into high-quality names with a high probability of upside movement. Since we all have to eat, that right there makes ADM worth considering as one of the best stocks to buy as a long-term consideration. 7 Industrial Stocks to Buy for a Rock-Solid Foundation But specific to our circumstances, Archer Daniels is putting up great numbers. In the first quarter of 2021, the company posted revenue of $18.9 billion, up 5% from Q4 2020. Dominion Energy (D) Source: ying / Shutterstock.com With the global markets turning shaky over recent sessions, the best stocks to buy are what many analysts consider the safest ones. Under this context, you could do a lot worse than Dominion Energy. A power and energy company \u2014 and not to be confused with that other company of the same name \u2014 Dominion Energy has an irreplaceable advantage: When people flip the switch, they expect the lights to turn on. Indeed, bad stuff happens when the lights stay off for an extended period. Beyond that, we live in a technologically dependent world. We cannot live without power, and therefore, people will do anything to keep those lights on. It\u2019s somewhat cynical, but it supports the case for D stock. Another reason why Dominion is one of the best stocks to buy with your tax refund is that utilities tend to perform relatively well during a deflationary environment. I\u2019d argue that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing. Our national gross domestic product (GDP) is back up to $22 trillion, yet our employment level is still down about 5%. Productivity up but worker base down translates to deflation. Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (KTOS) Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com As a defense contractor, Kratos Defense & Security Solutions is a tricky beast. Ordinarily, you wouldn\u2019t expect a left-leaning presidential administration to be supportive of an investment like KTOS stock. Certainly, the comparison to the very pro-military administration under former President Donald Trump isn\u2019t favorable for Kratos. However, you\u2019d have to be living under a rock not to notice multiple geopolitical rumblings. First, you have the tense relationship between President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Further, both confirmed and suspected Russian-backed cyberattacks put a dark cloud over U.S.-Russia relations, which may bolster military related names like KTOS stock. Second, our continued rivalry with China, along with the ever-present threat of nuclear-armed North Korea demonstrates that we must direct resources into maintaining our military advantage. Specifically, Kratos\u2019 specialty in advanced war machines such as drones might make it one of the best stocks to buy. 7 High Quality Industrial Stocks to Buy Now Nevertheless, KTOS is a stock you want to trickle your way into. Financially, Kratos\u2019 revenue growth has started to sag. That said, if tensions heat up with our adversaries \u2014 and that looks to be the case \u2014 KTOS at current prices may be a viable discount. H&R Block (HRB) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com I\u2019d be remiss not to mention H&R Block in an article about best stocks to buy with your tax refund. Now, time for a confession. Over the past two years or so, I\u2019ve supported the bullish narrative of HRB stock, only to be disappointed. Finally, though, the tax-preparation company is rewarding its longsuffering shareholders. On a year-to-date basis, HRB stock is up 59%. Better yet, momentum remains strong, with shares up nearly 15% over the trailing month. Part of the reason is a factor I\u2019ve long discussed: the transition to the gig economy. Prior to the pandemic, many young folks wanted to live life on their terms. During the lockdowns, many more people got a taste of the gig worker\u2019s culture. As the New York Times pointed out, worker bees want to keep the benefits of telecommuting. Undoubtedly, some will make the plunge. But tax preparation for 1099 contractors is far different from W2s, which bolsters HRB. Also, several investors got rich off cryptocurrencies in 2021. That, too, is a serious taxation concern, one that the IRS will prosecute with extreme prejudice. So, how\u2019s H&R Block looking now? Smith & Wesson Brands (SWBI) Source: Supakorn Pe / Shutterstock.com Another difficult name to figure out among best stocks to buy with your tax refund is Smith & Wesson Brands. I include it because there\u2019s a chance SWBI stock could fly higher from here due to a compelling mix of the unprecedented pandemic and political catalysts. Still, it\u2019s a risky one, so don\u2019t go too overboard. Let\u2019s start with some hard data. According to FBI background checks for firearm sales, the industry has sold just under 16 million guns between January through April. That\u2019s on pace for yet another record-breaking year for gun sales. Still, April sales slipped 25% from March. Is that a sign that SWBI stock is in trouble? It\u2019s not the most encouraging statistic. But we should note that April sales historically tend to be weak relative to March. Further, while the pandemic sparked gun sales in 2020, this year, the Democrats could do the same in 2021. After some ugly incidents following the 2020 election results, some fractures have opened within the Republican party. That sets the possibility that Democrats may retain power, which is fundamentally bad news for firearm advocates due to the threat of increased gun control. 7 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $3 But this could also spark panicked purchasing. Therefore, you should watch this space. Cinemark (CNK) Source: LukeandKarla.Travel/Shutterstock.com With Cinemark, I\u2019ve saved the riskiest idea for last. While CNK has the comeback narrative to be among the best stocks to buy period, it could also fall flat on its face. Therefore, you only want to spare a tiny portion of your refund on this cineplex operator. While so many industries suffered from the pandemic, companies like Cinemark were on the brink of absolute catastrophe. That\u2019s because without people flowing into their movie theaters, there was really no way to generate any revenue. But now that several states are loosening their Covid-19 protocol, CNK stock pinged signs of life. On a year-to-date basis, shares are up 28%. In the trailing month, momentum continues to be strong, up nearly 9%. But can the cineplex industry harness these gains into something sustainably substantive? I think it comes down to whether people can remember what it was like to be normal and human again. Clearly, some cities are doing much better than others. But should a sense of decency and civility return, the pent-up demand for the big-screen experience could swing the needle favorably for CNK stock.

(See ADM stock analysis on TipRanks) On May 3, Barclays analyst Benjamin Theurer reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $75 (10.9% upside potential) from $60. Theurer attributed the upward target price revision to a systemic shift in the Chinese pork industry, future benefits from renewable green diesel, and adjusted operating profit of $1 billion from Nutrition. Based on 7 Buys and 3 Holds, consensus on the Street is that ADM is a Moderate Buy. The average analyst price target of $68.70 implies the stock is fairly priced.

But they\u2019re buying wheat\u201d as well.The Asian nation\u2019s soaring demand for animal feed has helped lift crop prices to the highest in years, benefitting traders like ADM and signaling higher meat prices for consumers.Chinese hogs aren\u2019t the only culprits behind pricey corn. The world\u2019s cattle, hogs and chickens are all gobbling up the grain faster than farmers can grow it. Corn is so expensive that it has at times surpassed wheat, a rare occurrence.Earlier this month, a type of wheat grown in the southern U.S. Plains that\u2019s usually used to make flour for bread traded at the biggest discount to corn since 1977.The disparity prompted some U.S. cattle feeders to buy wheat that will get harvested beginning around June.\u201cWe are running out of the corn in the country and wheat got really cheap,\u201d said Joe Nussmeier, a broker at Frontier Futures in Minneapolis. By mid-June, \u201cthe only thing to feed critters at that time will be wheat.\u201dThere are risks, though. Wheat shouldn\u2019t be fed to younger cattle and if cattle eat too much wheat, they get bloated, according to Penn State Extension research. Researchers at North Dakota State University recommend that wheat make up no more than 15% of an animal\u2019s diet when it\u2019s being introduced.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=2dd6564ce58a196b93f065168bbdbf3db3b41540c5a7cea0964f3a4dc76502b6"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619550063, "headline": "Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) Q1 2021 Earnings Call Transcript", "id": 66831436, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?661048088", "related": "ADM", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "Image source: The Motley Fool.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e226a56e6acbdc91151b208ceafd1965c6918b8e97f391366ad74f1c43891fba"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619541240, "headline": "Archer Daniels Midland Co. stock outperforms competitors on strong trading day", "id": 66785772, "image": "https://images.mktw.net/im-220105/social", "related": "ADM", "source": "MarketWatch", "summary": "Shares of Archer Daniels Midland Co. rose 3.07% to $61.82 Tuesday, on what proved to be an all-around mixed trading session for the stock market, with the...", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=2704ad68673e650dcf1c3ad249ed9f6c72dccab7efa0b6dd442bcd5f882bceb6"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619541064, "headline": "Archer Daniels (ADM) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Top Estimates, Stock Up", "id": 66734729, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/L96uaDgK35mCVI1oI_OCeg--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MzU7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/zacks.com/5b7b26d8cb34af2f6ce824bbe1ee9efe", "related": "ADM", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "Archer Daniels' (ADM) Q1 results gain from solid revenues across all segments owing to healthy demand for its products.

Shares for Bunge, which reports earnings May 4, are up about 30% year-to-date.Prices for corn, soybeans and wheat started to climb in the third quarter of 2020 and have barely let up since, with prices extending gains to fresh multiyear peaks in the wake of the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s smaller-than-expected planting outlook on March 31.China\u2019s crop imports are likely to stay strong until at least the end of the year, with Cargill Inc. saying agricultural commodities are poised for a \u201cmini supercycle.\u201d But a prolonged bull cycle is unlikely are farmers are quick to plant more every year, boosting supplies quicker than in other commodities markets like metals, which have to be mined.The backdrop of tighter crop supplies is the opposite of the glut that capped trading margins in recent years. China\u2019s expanding hog herd has the U.S. shipping record amounts of corn to the Asian country. More cars and trucks on roads has lifted demand of corn-based ethanol and biodiesel made from soybeans.\u201cMy expectation is for the first quarter and at least the first half of 2021 that we\u2019ll see the continuation of favorable grain-merchandising conditions,\u201d said Seth Goldstein, analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. \u201cWe\u2019re at the point where grain trading is at peak profitability. Just a couple of years ago, we were at the bottom of the cycle and now we\u2019re at the top.\u201dThere are some pressure points, though. Corn and soy supplies are getting tight enough to pinch profits at processing plants. Soybean crush margins are sharply lower from the same time a year ago and the volume of soybeans crushed in the U.S. has declined from 2020 levels two months in a row.Meanwhile, top global soy producer Brazil cut its requirement for biodiesel blending in diesel fuel to 10% from 13% to ease the impact of high soybean oil prices. That move, according to BofA\u2019s Washer, \u201cthreatens soybean crush demand and highlights the risks associated with policy changes in Brazil.\u201dFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=41edec148ce32c0ab4bf7011b18e50604e2ab2d147c235ab5330f2e892a6c149"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619436794, "headline": "Corn futures jump to a 7-year high on supply concerns", "id": 66427532, "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106860748-16170221982021-03-29t105923z_2135399515_rc2ykm9crwlf_rtrmadp_0_usa-crops-farmers.jpeg?v=1617022247", "related": "ADM", "source": "CNBC", "summary": "Corn futures have climbed sharply in recent weeks, one of several price surges seen in commodities markets.

"ADM", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- China is driving growth in Asia\u2019s plant-based protein market as health-conscious consumers embrace an array of new products, according to Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., one of the world\u2019s biggest agricultural traders.The uptake of locally-sourced plant-based protein has generally been faster in China than in other parts of the world and the industry there is moving quickly beyond burger analogues, according to ADM Asia Pacific President Leo Liu. Alternatives to shrimp and shellfish, plant-based cheeses and ready-to-eat protein snacks are all becoming more popular, he said.\u201cAwareness and interest in plant-based proteins as an alternative to meat is growing,\u201d the Shanghai-based Liu said in an interview. Chinese people are experimenting with plant-based options as they look for protein-rich diets that are sustainable, convenient and meet food safety standards, he said.ADM -- one of the big four agricultural traders along with Cargill Inc., Bunge Ltd., and Louis Dreyfus Co. -- already has extensive operations throughout China and will be investing more in alternative proteins there, Liu said. The company forecasts China\u2019s plant-based protein market will grow to $14.5 billion in 2025 from under $10 billion in 2018.The rising interest in plant-based protein dovetails with Beijing\u2019s increasing focus on the environment and food security. Self-sufficiency featured strongly in China\u2019s latest five-year plan that came after the country\u2019s hog herd had been devastated by African swine fever and the trade war with the U.S. as well as the Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the fragility of global supply chains.Diversifying protein intake to plant-based sources could help China cope with future meat shortages, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Alvin Tai and Ashley Kim said in a report released in February. Reducing meat consumption is also part of China\u2019s strategy to reduce its carbon intensity by more than 65% from 2005 levels by 2030, they said.The growing number of Chinese flexitarians -- people who are mostly vegetarian but occasionally eat meat or fish -- is helping to spur alternative food startups across the country, Liu said. \u201cConsumers are moving away from an obsession with calorie counts to focusing on food\u2019s intrinsic value.\u201dMany China-based companies will continue to increase production capabilities as the popularity of plant-based meat continues to rise, Fitch Solutions said in a March 31 note.OmniFoods is distributing a ground pork substitute in Hong Kong, and mainland company Whole Perfect Food sells vegan bacon. Chinese startups Zhenmeat and Starfield Food & Science Technology, meanwhile, have sought funding to develop their own meat substitutes.Global InterestA bevy of global food titans are also seeking to get in on the action. Cargill started a plant-based meat products brand called PlantEver that\u2019s sold directly to Chinese consumers last year, while industry pioneer Beyond Meat Inc. opened its first manufacturing facility outside the U.S. near Shanghai this week. Livekindly Collective, a group of alternative protein brands steered by a former Unilever Plc executive, also has plans to expand in China.ADM, which says it\u2019s now the largest plant-based protein provider in the world, has for years been diversifying away from trading bulk crops and into higher-margin food manufacturing. The company expects its nutrition unit, which contains its plant-based protein business, to become as large or even larger than its legacy business of buying and shipping crops by 2050.See also: Beyond Meat Has an Ancient Foe in China -- Tofu: David FicklingOne of the biggest potential hurdles for the industry in China is competition from long-existing and cheaper soy-based products such as tofu, Liu said.\u201cWhile it might take some time to educate consumers about the new generation of plant-based food, the demand for plant-based foods in China will have a huge market potential once perception starts to shift and the taste and flavor of plant-based foods continue to improve,\u201d he said.(Updates with comment from Fitch Solutions in 8th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=0311fe3518dec149029c4e5aa80c34f39def8459e2a57b4762fbfc8f18133dc8"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1617899640, "headline": "Archer Daniels Midland Co. stock outperforms market on strong trading day", "id": 66108783, "image": "https://images.mktw.net/im-220105/social", "related": "ADM", "source": "MarketWatch", "summary": "Shares of Archer Daniels Midland Co. inched 0.52% higher to $58.14 Thursday, on what proved to be an all-around positive trading session for the stock...", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7b4f255f390b777a502872f5fc57a13fac6a58d980ee2e121354ff243a7464ba"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1617813240, "headline": "Archer Daniels Midland Co. stock falls Wednesday, underperforms market", "id": 66108784, "image": "https://images.mktw.net/im-220105/social", "related": "ADM", "source": "MarketWatch", "summary": "Shares of Archer Daniels Midland Co. shed 0.34% to $57.84 Wednesday, on what proved to be an all-around great trading session for the stock market, with the...", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b3b1851b4c0b0476f6685f980e4b7ab491c59d7ccb8315a7298f3d7b88b2e366"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1617802830, "headline": "Is ADM Stock A Buy or Sell?", "id": 66513816, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FmSSxeqSQ87cFOMD0sYeWw--~B/aD02MDA7dz00NTA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/insidermonkey.com/aac5937a7353b9570945eaf65ba53916", "related": "ADM", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "With the fourth-quarter round of 13F filings behind us it is time to take a look at the stocks in which some of the best money managers in the world preferred to invest or sell heading into the first quarter of 2021.

Rivals Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. and Bunge Ltd. are working on making plants more efficient, and Andersons Inc. set up a desk to trade feedstocks for the green fuel.The traders are targeting the growing market as American refiners including Phillips 66, Marathon Petroleum Corp., HollyFrontier Corp. and Valero Energy Corp. jump on the green diesel bandwagon. Renewable diesel is a fuel made from biomass that has the same properties of the fossil fuel, and it\u2019s likely to benefit from President Joe Biden\u2019s sweeping climate agenda that signals a push away from fossil fuels. While many refiners will seek to produce it from discarded cooking oil or animal fats, they will need to turn to traditional vegetable oils made from crops like corn and soybeans to meet demand.\u201cWe think it\u2019s going to be a big market,\u201d said Pat Bowe, chief executive officer of crop handler Andersons. \u201cIt\u2019s a really important demand driver for the fats and oils complex that we haven\u2019t seen in a long time.\u201dThe increased demand comes just as restaurants across America are reopening, boosting demand for cooking oils, and driving miles recover to pre-pandemic levels. That\u2019s boosted competition with the food industry, which uses the oils in everything from Nutella -- a key consumer of palm oil -- to plant-based burgers, many of which have soybean oil as a key ingredient.Soybean oil demand could increase by half a billion pounds this year due to the extra demand from the renewable diesel industry, Juan Luciano, ADM\u2019s CEO said in January. If two-thirds of the planned renewable diesel capacity gets built over the next three to four years, that will require about 15 billion pounds of feedstock, Ray Young, the company\u2019s chief financial officer said this month.\u201cRegardless of how you do the arithmetic, it\u2019s going to be an environment where soybean oil is going to be very, very valued by the industry as an important feedstock to support the growth of renewable green diesel,\u201d Young said at an investment conference. \u201cWe think this is going to be a very favorable multiyear phenomenon for the North American soy crush industry.\u201dCargill\u2019s investments include doubling soybean processing capacity at its plant in Sidney, Ohio, and expanding processing by 10% in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. ADM said it\u2019s working on improving efficiency at its plants to provide incremental supply while Andersons set up a trading desk in Kansas City last year to buy and sell feedstocks including soybean oil, tallow and the corn oil it produces from its many ethanol plants, Bowe said in an interview last month.Bunge, the world\u2019s largest oilseeds processor, said it plans to allocate some capital for investments in the area, which include increasing tank-storage capacity and improving efficiency of its refineries. While the traders all want to supply the renewable diesel industry, they don\u2019t want to produce it themselves.The market is already taking notice of the new demand. Soybean oil futures have jumped almost 25% this year as palm oil also extended gains. Demand is also gaining as blending traditional biodiesel into fossil fuels has become more profitable with the rise in crude oil prices.\u201cRenewable diesel should see growing demand as long as government incentives remain in place,\u201d said Seth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. \u201cIf the Biden administration is able to get clean fuel standards passed for heavy trucks, the U.S. would likely see a spike in demand for renewable diesel.\u201dBut there\u2019s also the risk of over-investing. Some traditional biodiesel plants may end up closing as a result of the renewable diesel boom, while too many traders fighting for one market could end up squeezing margins.\u201cWe\u2019re going to be very thoughtful and show a lot of discipline, which this industry needs to do,\u201d Bunge CEO Greg Heckman said in February, adding that the company was being \u201cthoughtful about how we serve this growing demand that is structural and is going to be in place.\u201dFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3bf7b6ce2b9a147f47d50847549d9dce52999db43c7b3aa2e18eecd89e7085a8"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1617087600, "headline": "BROKER RATINGS: Deutsche Bank ups Moncler to Buy; HSBC cuts Iberdrola", "id": 66274689, "image": "", "related": "ADM", "source": "Alliance News", "summary": "Looking for stock market analysis and research with proves results?
