The shares will start trading on a split-adjusted basis on August 2. Shares closed down 1.7% at $12.78 on June 18.\n\n\n\nOver the years, GE has gradually divested several businesses, including nearly all of GE Capital, without making any related alterations to reduce the share count. (See GE stock chart on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nCarolina Dybeck Happe, the company\u2019s Senior VP, and CFO said, \u201cThe reverse stock split will better align GE\u2019s number of shares outstanding with companies of our size and scope. It also marks another step in GE\u2019s transformation to be a more focused, simpler, stronger high-tech industrial company.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce the stock split is effective, every eight shares of GE\u2019s common stock issued and outstanding, or held as treasury stock, will automatically combine into one share, reducing the company\u2019s float from the current approximately 8.8 billion to around 1.1 billion.\n\n\n\nThe reverse split will also be reflected in GE\u2019s amended certificate of corporation with a reduced number of authorized shares to a revised par value of $0.01 per share.\n\n\n\nThe company also stated that no fractional shares will be issued, and shareholders eligible for a fractional share will be paid a cash consideration in lieu of such fractional shares.\n\n\n\nIn a separate release, the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.01 per share. The dividend is payable on July 26 to shareholders of record at the close on June 28, with an ex-dividend date of June 25.\n\n\n\nThe company's shares will continue to trade on the NYSE and other stock exchanges under their current symbols but will have new CUSIP and ISIN numbers assigned to them effective August 2.\n\n\n\nAt a recent investor conference, General Electric CEO Larry Culp suggested a positive outlook for the company\u2019s Renewable and Healthcare segments and said he was confident about the recovery of the Aviation segment by the second half of 2021.\n\n\n\nFollowing the conference, BofA analyst Andrew Obin reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $15, implying 17.4% upside potential to current levels.\n\n\n\nThe Wall Street community is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 5 Buys versus 5 Holds. The GE average analyst\u00a0price target of $13.89\u00a0implies 8.7% upside potential to current levels. Shares have gained 81.5% over the past year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated News:Best Stock For DividendsU.S. Steel Provides Upbeat Q2 Guidance; Shares Plunge on Worries of Increased Metal SupplyFisker and Magna Ink Long-Term Manufacturing Deal; Fisker Shares JumpFord Raises Q2 EBIT Estimates, Claims Vehicle Orders are Expanding", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=de9f38db2521ef1fe7cdcaafca1335cafbb9cae4b3fbb306183ff21b543360b3"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1624108020, "headline": "GE and Safran Trash Boeing CEO's Jet Engine Prediction", "id": 68373741, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Y.XKL7fLegAmduOi2k.faQ--~B/aD05MzM7dz0xNDAwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/717d0a173f100c044b3c0ba10249e6a1", "related": "GE", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "The industrial giants' CFM joint venture has lofty fuel-efficiency goals for its next jet engine project.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b30ee2a36bd2e4fb2c1c5aeff5329c64e0b5c67a1a98c7146c3347cd72a10244"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1624093620, "headline": "GE and Safran Trash Boeing CEO's Jet Engine Prediction", "id": 68374698, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?322669496", "related": "GE", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "Back in April, Boeing (NYSE: BA) CEO Dave Calhoun made a bold prediction.

Recently, the biopharmaceutical company came out with positive safety results of Cohort 1 of OASIS. This is the company\u2019s ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial of CLS-AX, which is administered by suprachoroidal injection via Clearside\u2019s SCS Microinjector in six patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD).\n\n\n\nClearside Chief Medical Officer commented, \u201cWe are very encouraged by the Cohort 1 results of the OASIS trial and we are immediately beginning Cohort 2 enrollment as planned. The initial data from Cohort 1 clearly achieved our safety and tolerability endpoints. While still early and recognizing there are a limited number of patients, we believe the Cohort 1 data supports our hypothesis that the combination of targeted and compartmentalized suprachoroidal delivery and the potent pan-VEGF attributes of axitinib may facilitate an effective treatment option for patients suffering from wet AMD.\u201d\n\n\n\nDocument Security Systems (DSS) was the biggest laggard in pre-market trading, as the stock dropped around 40.9% at the time of writing. Recently, the packaging and security printing solutions provider announced the pricing of an underwritten common stock public offering of 29 million shares at a price of $1.50 per share.\n\n\n\nThe gross proceeds of the offering are likely to be $43.5 million, excluding underwriting discounts and commissions, and other costs. These proceeds are expected to be channeled into growth, development, opportunistic acquisitions, and other general corporate needs.\n\n\n\nNotably, the underwriters have been granted a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 15% of shares of common stock offered to cover over-allotments, if any. This option, if exercised in full, is anticipated to enhance the total gross proceeds of the offering to around $50 million.\n\n\n\nIn M&A news, Accenture (ACN), the global professional services company, has revealed the acquisition of umlaut, an engineering consulting and services firm.

(MRNA) has submitted an application to Swissmedic for the authorized use of its COVID-19 vaccine in adolescents in Switzerland. Last week, an application for emergency use authorization (EUA) with the FDA was also submitted by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology company to administer the vaccine to adolescents in the United States.\n\n\n\nIn May, the company announced that the Phase 2/3 TeenCOVE study of its COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) met its primary immunogenicity endpoint in adolescents. The study showed no cases of COVID-19 infection in individuals administered with two doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, using the primary definition. Furthermore, the vaccine represented an efficacy of 93% in seronegative participants 14 days after receiving the first dose, when using the secondary CDC case definition of COVID-19, which tested for the milder disease.\n\n\n\nModerna CEO Stephane Bancel commented, \u201cWe are pleased to announce that we have submitted an authorization application for our COVID-19 vaccine with Swissmedic for use in adolescents in Switzerland. We are encouraged that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was highly effective at preventing COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 infection in adolescents.

I think that phenomenon is playing out now with clean-energy stocks in general and Stem (NYSE:STEM) stock in particular. Source: Lightboxx/ShutterStock.com Stem has developed software, powered by artificial intelligence, that increases the efficiency of lithium-ion batteries and enables more cost-effective, resilient connections with electricity grids. Importantly, the company\u2019s technology and products have been validated by the high quality of its customers, investors, and management team, as well as by its extremely rapid revenue growth. Moreover, Stem is positioned to get a big boost from strong macro trends going forward.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Missing the Big Macro Picture As I\u2019ve noted in previous columns, the U.S., China, the EU, Japan, and India, cumulatively representing the lion\u2019s share of the world\u2019s economy, are now ploughing a tremendous amount of resources into clean energy. And many of the world\u2019s largest companies \u2013 like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), and Blackstone (NYSE:BX) \u2013 are doing the same. In such an environment, the leading companies facilitating the revolution, including Stem, will easily be able to grow rapidly and generate huge profits over the longer term. 10 of the Top Nasdaq Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy Yet many of the sector\u2019s stocks have tumbled recently. One example is STEM stock, whose shares have tumbled about 50% since peaking on Feb. 17. (Actually, most of that decline was generated by Star Peak Energy, the SPAC which had agreed to merge with Stem last December. The merger became effective on April 28, and Stem began trading under its own name on April 29). I believe that the reason for the decline in clean energy names is that many on the Street are focusing on peripheral issues like higher interest rates and whether the Biden administration\u2019s stimulus plan will pass Congress. (I believe that the initiative will pass in some form. And even if it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m confident that the administration will find many other ways of backing the clean-energy sector, including electricity-storage initiatives that will boost Stem\u2019s results.) The Validation of Stem and Its Products As I noted in a previous column, Stem has many huge customers, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), UPS (NYSE:UPS), Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTX). It also counts 40-plus utilities and five grid operators among its customers, CEO John Carrington said on a recent conference call. Additionally, Stem has a few very prominent investors, including General Electric (NYSE:GE), Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, and Blackstone, as Mike Morgan, Star Peak\u2019s chairman, pointed out during the recent conference call. Meanwhile, Stem has put up some extraordinarily impressive growth numbers. For example, its 12-month pipeline is $1.6 billion and it has signed contracts for $200 million of its backlogged deals. Moreover, the company expects its revenue to jump 450% in 2021, and almost 90% of that growth had been underwritten as of the end of last year, Carrington said. Speaking of Carrington, he has a very impressive background, as he was First Solar\u2019s (NASDAQ:FSLR) executive vice president of marketing and business development and head of GE\u2019s commercial operations in Asia. More Specific Macro Drivers As renewable energy proliferates, the demand for batteries will surge. That\u2019s because, due to the intermittent nature of renewables, energy must be stored for the times when the sun and/or wind are not generating power. The rapidly dropping price of batteries will also cause demand for them to jump; according to Carrington, battery hardware costs have tumbled 25 times in the last 10 years. And experts expect them to keep getting cheaper. Finally, increased use of renewables will raise demand for Stem\u2019s Athena system which lowers the cost of utilizing clean energy. The Bottom Line on STEM Stock STEM stock has a huge opportunity and gigantic market drivers. Meanwhile, the company and its products have received a great deal of validation, and the company\u2019s risk/reward ratio has greatly improved in recent weeks due to the large pullback of its shares. Given these points, I recommend that long-term investors buy STEM stock. On the date of publication, Larry Ramer was long GE stock.

While its adjusted profits were two cents better than analyst estimates, it missed the top-line consensus by $420 million. That news pushed GE stock lower. Source: testing / Shutterstock.com However, despite a mixed quarter, I see a company that looks ready to again become the dividend grower that it was for so many years before \u2014 the company General Electric was until it cut its dividend to just a penny back in December 2018. Here\u2019s why I feel this way about GE stock. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips GE Stock: Free Cash Flow Is Getting Stronger As any investor worth their salt knows, a company pays its dividends from excess cash. As such, those names that generate healthy cash flow have no problem increasing their dividends from year to year. At the height of its dividend-paying glory in 2008, GE stock paid out $1.24 (split-adjusted) in annual dividends. It\u2019s never been that high since. In that fiscal year, its industrial businesses had cash flow from operating activities of $19.1 billion (Page 75). After subtracting $3 billion in capital expenditures, its industrial business had free cash flow (FCF) of $16.1 billion. In 2020, GE\u2019s four industrial businesses generated FCF of $606 million, down from $2.3 billion in 2019 and $4.8 billion in 2018. 10 of the Top Nasdaq Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy In 2008, its industrial businesses generated almost 27 times as much FCF as they did in 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, the industrial businesses had FCF of -$845 million, 62% higher than a year earlier. That\u2019s still not positive, but considerably better than it was at this point last year. On the results, CEO Larry Culp noted: \u201cI am proud of the GE team\u2019s solid first quarter results, despite a still difficult environment for Aviation. We are improving our cash performance and profitability with Industrial free cash flow growth of $1.7 billion year-over-year.\u201d In the results, the company also reiterated its full-year outlook for 2021, stating that GE Industrial\u2019s FCF will be between $2.5 billion and $4.5 billion. That\u2019s a 313% increase over 2020 at the low end of its FCF estimate and a 643% increase at the high end. To get back to $1.24 in dividends paid out annually, GE would have to generate approximately $10.9 billion (8.8 billion shares outstanding multiplied by $1.24) in FCF to accommodate such a payment. So, clearly, this is not going to happen in 2021 or even 2022. However, it could happen in 2023 if Culp\u2019s plans gain further traction and the company\u2019s FCF continues to strengthen. GE and Its Current Dividends Anyone who\u2019s been a long-term GE stock shareholder must find it difficult to see the current dividend yield at a meager 0.3%. This low yield is part of the price that had to be paid for Culp to accelerate debt repayment. Since the end of 2018, GE has reduced its debt by more than $70 billion. This alone makes Culp\u2019s tenure a success. However, it is the CEO\u2019s decentralization efforts that will determine the company\u2019s future. A lean organization that\u2019s closer to the customer ought to help reignite GE\u2019s growth engine. When you consider the fact that this company\u2019s Power and Renewable Energy segments accounted for about 43% of $16 billion-plus in industrial revenue in Q1, but neither made a profit, the upside is actually quite promising from an overall earnings perspective. If both of these segments had 5% profit margins in Q1 2021, you\u2019re talking about a $358 million profit on $7.1 billion in revenue rather than a $321 million loss. That\u2019s a turnaround of almost $700 million. Based on 8.8 billion shares outstanding, that $700 million equates to about eight cents a share in potential dividends that GE could have paid out. I realize this is only theoretical, but imagine how much GE stock would jump on news that it was increasing its quarterly dividend by 700% \u2014 from just a penny to eight cents per share. All I know is this would be significant. The Bottom Line on GE Stock I recently recommended GE stock as one of 10 dividend stocks to buy under $25. Part of my rationale for doing so was GE\u2019s sale of GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), the company\u2019s aircraft leasing business, to Aercap (NYSE:AER) for $24 billion in cash and 46% of the combined company. I wrote on Mar. 31: \u201cCulp believes the deleveraging and de-risking of its balance sheet puts the company in a better position to focus on its other operating segments. As stated in the press release for the AerCap sale, the \u2018deal marks GE\u2019s transformation to a more focused, simpler, and stronger industrial company.\u201d I agree with that sentiment still. Returning to its roots ought to get GE back in the good graces of dividend investors everywhere in due course. In the meantime, take advantage of any volatility on the downside, buying GE stock in the $12 range or even lower. This time next year, we might not be able to include General Electric in a discussion about dividend stocks to buy under $25.

That trailed the $17.6 billion expected by Wall Street. Orders fell in aviation and two other manufacturing units and GE\u2019s steady financial forecast made for a \u201cnegative contrast\u201d with conglomerates that have raised their outlook, said John Inch, an analyst at Gordon Haskett.The report left investors with little to get excited about in the immediate future as Culp continues his efforts to restore some of the company\u2019s lost glory. GE, which surprised Wall Street with a cash-flow rebound in the second half of 2020 and a robust outlook for further gains this year, is now banking on Covid-19 vaccinations to spur air travel and rekindle demand for its jet engines and related services -- all while continuing to fix its other businesses.Air travel is recovering in the U.S. and activity in China is above 2019 levels, \u201cbut you\u2019ve got other parts of the world which are clearly going to be more challenged,\u201d Culp said in an interview. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in India is nothing short of a humanitarian crisis and we see that. It\u2019s our second largest footprint for GE, so we\u2019ve got unfortunately very good visibility on all of that.\u201dThe shares fell less than 1% to $13.45 at 3:43 p.m. in New York after dropping as much as 4.9% for the biggest intraday decline in six weeks. The slide extended a retreat that began in March after GE agreed to sell its aircraft lessor to Ireland\u2019s AerCap Holdings NV. Before that, GE had been rallying strongly this year.\u2018Mixed Result\u2019In the first quarter, revenue fell 28% at GE\u2019s jet engine unit while orders tumbled almost as much. The Boston-based company has said it expects annual aviation revenue to be up or flat, driven by a recovery in the second half of the year.Revenue and orders also dropped in the power-equipment division and health-care unit, which makes medical scanners. Only the renewable energy business posted gains in those categories.GE\u2019s \u201cmixed result\u201d provided \u201climited signs of inflection anywhere,\u201d Steve Tusa, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in a report.Adjusted earnings climbed by a penny to three cents a share, topping the 1.4-cent average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. GE\u2019s industrial divisions burned $845 million in the first quarter. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected cash use of $663.9 million.Seasonal WeaknessCash generation is typically weak in the first quarter for GE. Culp said GE was close to breaking even on a cash-flow basis in the period, excluding an $800 million headwind from the elimination of most of its factoring, a practice in which the company sells receivables to a partner to raise short-term cash.\u201cWe\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019ve seen in the first quarter,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would frame it as a solid start to the year.\u201dGE included the factoring hit in its first-quarter results, but plans to adjust out the effects starting in the second quarter, Culp said. So while another blow of as much as $4 billion is likely in the second quarter from the elimination of factoring, that will be excluded from its cash-flow numbers.\u201cWe will take great pains as we go through the year to explain it in a way that represents our underlying operating reality,\u201d Culp said.Busy QuarterThe results cap a busy quarter in which GE announced the $30 billion air-leasing deal with AerCap. With the transaction, which is expected to close by early next year, GE is unloading the last major vestige of its troubled GE Capital financial-services arm.The results of what\u2019s left of GE Capital will be reported in the company\u2019s industrial balance sheet. GE has said it plans to use proceeds from the deal to repay another $30 billion in debt, bringing its total reduction of borrowing since 2018 to $70 billion.Culp last year slashed jobs and hoarded cash after the pandemic crushed global air travel and threatened his repair job at GE. The company\u2019s sprawling jet-engine division continues to weigh on results as customers Boeing Co. and Airbus SE contend with weak demand for new planes.GE\u2019s engine-maintenance business has also been suffering, with U.S. flight departures in mid-April down 30% from pre-pandemic levels. The company tracks departures as a gauge of demand for lucrative spare parts and services.
