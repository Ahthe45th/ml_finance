However, shares fell almost 2% on May 25. The company\u2019s revenues of $3.7 billion surpassed the Street\u2019s estimates of $3.26 billion and jumped 31.4% from the year-ago period. Earnings came in at $26.48 per share, beating the consensus estimates of $20.14 per share and soared 84% year-over-year. The increase in earnings was driven by stronger commercial sales in the quarter. Notably, domestic same store sales increased 28.9% in the fiscal third quarter. AutoZone CEO Bill Rhodes said, \u201cThe investments we are making in Commercial pricing, service and assortment are strengthening our competitive position in this large, fragmented market. We intend to accelerate our Company\u2019s historical Commercial growth rate as we increase our penetration in this market.\u201d He added, \u201cWhile we understand sales trends will slow, we must work diligently during this fourth quarter to maintain the share gains we have achieved\u2026Additionally, we remain committed to investing appropriately in a safe and productive environment for our customers and AutoZoners.\u201d (See AutoZone stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the fiscal Q3 earnings release, Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel assigned a Buy rating and a price target of $1,670 (17.6% upside potential). Nagel commented, \u201cWe look very favorably upon recent trends at AZO and view accelerating sales and profitability at the company as reflective of management capitalizing successfully on economic re-opening tailwinds and consistent with our positive near- and longer-term calls on shares.\u201d The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That\u2019s based on 11 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $1,588.46 implies 11.8% upside potential to current levels. Shares have increased 26.9% over the past six months.

(NYSE: AZO) today reported net sales of $3.7 billion for its third quarter (12 weeks) ended May 8, 2021, an increase of 31.4% from the third quarter of fiscal 2020 (12 weeks). Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, increased 28.9% for the quarter. For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 52.4%, a decrease of 118 basis points versus the prior year. The decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by the accelerated growth in our Commercial business and our investment in pricing initiatives. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, was 30.4% versus 35.9% for last year\u2019s quarter. The decrease in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, was driven by strong sales growth and approximately $75 million in prior year pandemic related expenses, including Emergency Time-Off (\u201cETO\u201d) for our AutoZoners. Operating profit increased 63.4% to $803.5 million. Net income for the quarter increased 73.9% over the same period last year to $596.2 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 84.0% to $26.48 per share from $14.39 per share in the year-ago quarter. The increase in net income was driven by strong topline growth and operating expense leverage. AutoZone repurchased 663,328 shares of its common stock for $900.0 million during the third quarter, at an average price of $1,357 per share. At the end of the third quarter, the Company had $1.3 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorization. The Company\u2019s inventory increased 5.1% over the same period last year, driven by new stores and improved product assortment. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, on a per store basis, was negative $167 thousand versus negative $56 thousand last year and negative $93 thousand last quarter.\u201cWe are very proud to report another quarter of exceptionally strong same store sales and earnings growth. The AutoZone team has done a wonderful job of managing, and leading, throughout this pandemic. While our DIY business was again very strong this quarter, our Commercial business\u2019 44% sales growth stood out as exceptional. The investments we are making in Commercial pricing, service and assortment are strengthening our competitive position in this large, fragmented market. We intend to accelerate our Company\u2019s historical Commercial growth rate as we increase our penetration in this market. While we understand sales trends will slow, we must work diligently during this fourth quarter to maintain the share gains we have achieved. As always, we cannot take anything for granted, but we remain excited about the ongoing sales opportunities in front of us. Additionally, we remain committed to investing appropriately in a safe and productive environment for our customers and AutoZoners. As we opportunistically invest capital in our business, we remain committed to our disciplined approach of increasing operating earnings and cash flow, and of utilizing our balance sheet and capital effectively,\u201d said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. During the quarter ended May 8, 2021, AutoZone opened 25 new stores and closed one store in the U.S. and opened seven stores in Mexico and one store in Brazil. As of May 8, 2021, the Company had 5,975 stores in the U.S., 635 in Mexico and 47 in Brazil for a total store count of 6,657.

According to General Motors, total industry vehicle sales came in at 15.9 million units (at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate) in the third quarter, reflecting an increase of about 4 million units from the second quarter. Consumers are preferring owned-vehicles to public transportation due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Also, the demand for used cars has been strong over recent months.\u00a0Challenging macro conditions are impacting consumers\u2019 spending capacity, thus boosting the demand for used vehicles compared to new vehicles.Auto parts retailers have also gained momentum over recent months as people are spending their extra time at home toward DIY (do-it-yourself) vehicle repairs and maintenance activity. Against this backdrop, we will use the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool to place AutoZone and Advance Auto Parts alongside each other and see which auto parts retailer offers a more compelling investment opportunity.AutoZone (AZO)AutoZone, the largest US retailer of automotive replacement parts and accessories, operates 5,885 stores in the country, 621 stores in Mexico and 43 stores in Brazil. After facing challenges in 3Q FY20 due to the temporary closure of stores amid pandemic-led lockdowns, the company\u2019s domestic same-store sales grew 21.8% in 4Q FY20 (ended Aug 29). According to CEO Bill Rhodes, 4Q same-store sales growth marked the company\u2019s largest quarterly growth since going public in 1991.Overall, 4Q FY20 sales increased 14% to $4.5 billion year-over-year with same-store sales of the company\u2019s DIY business rising 24%. The DIY category benefited as people had more time at their hands to pursue car enhancement and maintenance projects. The company also attributed the demand to COVID-19 unemployment benefits.In addition, AutoZone experienced strong growth in its online channels. However, online sales still account for less than 5% of the DIY business. Meanwhile, total DIFM (do-it-for-me) sales increased 16.8% to $976 million year-over-year. Strong top-line growth helped the company deliver EPS of $30.93 in 4Q FY20, reflecting a 47.6% growth on an adjusted basis.AutoZone did not provide guidance for FY21 due to COVID-related uncertainties. At the same time, the company said that it expects sales growth to moderate over time. However, it continues to foresee high demand for its products and services given the challenging economic conditions in which consumers tend to improve their existing vehicles rather than buy a new one.The company expects to open about 150 new stores in the US and 50 international stores in FY21. That's up from the opened 113 US stores and 25 stores across Mexico and Brazil in FY20. It also plans to gradually resume its share buyback program in 1Q FY21 after the temporary suspension in March. (See AZO stock analysis on TipRanks)On Oct. 13, Raymond James analyst Matthew McClintock raised the stock's price target to $1,565 from $1,500 and reiterated his Buy rating. The analyst called AutoZone his top pick and noted \u201cManagement gave rare forward commentary for the first time in at least five years, and we certainly believe it was positive for both the forward quarter (1Q21) and forward year (FY21).\u201dCommenting on the commercial business, the analyst added \u201cAfter more than five years of long-term investments in the DIFM business (as well as persistent skepticism from the investment community), AZO began to deliver outstanding growth and returns for this segment over a year ago, which was only further demonstrated by recent results. We firmly believe that market consolidation opportunities in a post COVID world should only increase our pre COVID expectations for growth in this segment.\u201dThe Street is in line with McClintock\u2019s bullish stance. A Strong Buy consensus on AutoZone stock is based on 10 Buys versus 2 Holds and no Sells. With shares down 0.74% year-to-date, the average analyst price target of $1,409.08 implies upside potential of 19.1% in the 12 months ahead.Advance Auto Parts (AAP)Auto aftermarket parts retailer Advance Auto Parts sells its products to professional installers and DIY customers through its 4,819 stores and 167 Worldpac branches in the US, Canada, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. The company also serves a network of 1,262 independently owned Carquest brand stores.Following an 8.6% decline in 1Q FY20 sales, Advance Auto bounced back in 2Q FY20 (ended Jul. 11) with sales rising 7.3% to $2.5 billion year-over-year. Comparable store sales growth of 7.5% in 2Q marked the highest quarterly growth rate for the company in nearly 10 years. The company attributed strong sales momentum to a spike in industry demand driven by government stimulus, unemployment benefits and a rise in DIY projects.Notably, the company\u2019s DIY omnichannel business drove comparable sales growth in the second quarter and performed better than the DIFM business. The DIY omnichannel business benefited from the company\u2019s nationwide launch of the same-day delivery facility and initiatives to strengthen the front-end user experience on the online platform, which helped in boosting site traffic and conversion rates.However, the DIFM business was hit by the temporary closure of garages across North America due to the pandemic. Plus, Advance Auto\u2019s Professional business derives a significant proportion of its sales from the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and the West Coast regions, which were severely impacted by COVID-19.Robust sales growth coupled with margin expansion due to favorable channel mix, supply chain efficiencies and cost savings helped in driving 46% growth in 2Q adjusted EPS to $2.92. In addition, Advance auto has been enhancing its supply chain through improved execution and standardization in its distribution centers.It has resumed its single warehouse management system or WMS initiative after halting it in 2Q. Under this initiative, Advance Auto is consolidating its warehouse management system across all its distribution centers. The company aims to complete WMS implementation in its large distribution centers by the end of 2021.Backed by the results, Advance Auto lifted the temporary suspension of its share repurchase program. Looking ahead, the company did not provide a forecast for 3Q but said that DIY momentum in the second quarter continued into the third quarter.\u00a0(See AAP stock analysis on TipRanks)Earlier this month, JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers upgraded AAP to Buy from Hold and raised the price target to $190 from $183.The analyst cited five reasons for the upgrade \u201c(1) strong/sustainable current trends bridging to an easy winter weather comparison with this year looking relatively better vs. an acutely warm winter last year that hurt AAP more than peers (one of the reasons why we downgraded in January); (2) 'own the Pro in 2021' given AAP\u2019s ~50% DIFM mix combined with the exaggerated impact COVID-19 had on DIFM trends in its core Northeast market; (3) increasing top-line benefits from the peak repair cohort (6-12 years old) in 2021 and 2022; (4) AAP\u2019s margin story blossoms in 2021 and more so in 2022 as the company progresses on its transformation; and (5) stock underperformance relative to the market.\"Overall, the Street is cautiously optimistic on the stock with 10 Buys, 3 Holds and 2 Sells adding up to a Moderate Buy analyst consensus. The average analyst price target of $174.83 implies upside potential of 13% over the coming 12 months. That's after shares declined 3.4% so far this year.ConclusionThe Street has a more bullish outlook on AutoZone stock compared to Advance Auto Parts. Moreover, a lower valuation multiple and higher upside potential make AutoZone stock a better retail pick than Advance Auto currently.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks\u2019\u00a0Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks\u2019 equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

The economy had been booming prior to the health crisis, and many of the factors that caused the boom are still in play \u2013 a general tax cut, and the deregulation policy of the Trump Administration.But a decent governmental attitude toward business is not the only factor giving a lift to the economy. A combination of a generous stimulus package and extended benefits put in place earlier this year, along with pent-up demand from the long lock-down periods and a strong desire in many parts of the country to just get back to work, have given life to hopes of a V-shaped recovery. A feeling of optimism, even in a tough time, and a perception that there are opportunities available, has Wall Street\u2019s analysts tagging stocks for success. We\u2019ve pulled up the TipRanks data on three stocks that high-rated analysts have tagged as potentially strong investments. Between Wall Street\u2019s professionals, and the latest data, here\u2019s what makes them compelling buys.Calix, Inc. (CALX)We\u2019ll start in the tech sector, with Calix, a cloud computing company offering business software platforms designed to allow customers to monetize the interactions between infrastructure and service subscribers. The company\u2019s software products are cloud based, and make broadband access and data analysis easier for customers.Calix\u2019s success is clear from its annual revenues \u2013 and its growing sales and earnings recovery during the corona crisis of recent months. The company saw over $420 million on the lop line last year, and revenues in 1H20 grew sequentially from Q1 to Q2, coming in at $119 million for the second quarter. Earnings were negative in Q1, but quickly recovered and turned positive in Q2, coming in at 8 cents per share- the highest earnings the company has seen in over two years.Share prices have predictably grown as Calix beat the macro trends on sales and earnings. The stock is up an impressively robust 157% year-to-date.5-star analyst Richard Valera, of Needham, sees Calix as a long-term choice for investors, so much so that he has initiated coverage of the stock with a Buy rating and a $25 price target that suggest a 21% upside for the stock. (To watch Valera\u2019s track record, click here)\u201cCOVID-19 has accelerated the demand for robust consumer broadband service. As a provider of broadband access solutions, we expect Calix to benefit from this demand\u2026 Benefiting from growing secular broadband demand, a model transitioning towards software, and the imminent start of a $20B, 10-year broadband subsidy program (RDOF), we look for CALX to show sustained growth and margin expansion over the next several years,\u201d Valera commented.Overall, Calix has a unanimous Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, based on 4 Buy reviews. Shares are selling for $20.85, and the $25.50 average price target implies a one-year upside of 24%. (See CALX stock analysis on TipRanks)Gores Metropoulos (GMHI)Next on our list, Gores Metropoulos, is an associated company of the Gores Group. GMHI is a blank check company, existing to effect corporate mergers and capital exchanges, by acquisition of assets, stocks, and other business recombinations. Gores Metropoulos focuses on diversity in its portfolio, conducting acquisitions and management of companies in the business services, consumer products, healthcare, industrial, tech, and telecom segments.GMHI\u2019s most recent merger agreement is with Luminar, a company in the autonomous vehicle sector. The agreement was completed this past August and was valued at nearly $3 billion. Under the terms, Luminar gets a cash infusion of $400 million, and begins trading on the NASDAQ. This example is typical of GMHI\u2019s transactions.Analyst Gus Richard, covering this stock for Northland Securities, is impressed by the potential of the Luminar agreement. The possibilities induced him to initiate coverage of the stock.\u201cLARZ has developed an inexpensive lidar system design for the automotive market. LARZ has contracts with Volvo and one other top tier auto OEM.

In Q2, revenues came in at $2.8 billion, and in the third quarter, the company\u2019s fiscal fourth, revenues grew to $4.5 billion. Included in that result is a 21.8% growth in same-store sales year-over-year. The company credits the strong growth to customer behavior, and shift during the pandemic crisis toward DIY projects.Like Amazon, Autozone does not pay a dividend and rewards investors through share appreciation. The company\u2019s stock price is high, at $1,193, and has fully recovered from the mid-winter market crash, trading now within $2 of its December 31 closing price. Over the past three years, AZO shares have gained 96% in value.Raymond James analyst Matthew McClintock is impressed by Autozone, and upgraded his stance from Outperform to Strong Buy.

Between Wall Street\u2019s professionals, and the latest data, here\u2019s what makes them compelling buys.Calix, Inc. (CALX)We\u2019ll start in the tech sector, with Calix, a cloud computing company offering business software platforms designed to allow customers to monetize the interactions between infrastructure and service subscribers. The company\u2019s software products are cloud based, and make broadband access and data analysis easier for customers.Calix\u2019s success is clear from its annual revenues \u2013 and its growing sales and earnings recovery during the corona crisis of recent months. The company saw over $420 million on the lop line last year, and revenues in 1H20 grew sequentially from Q1 to Q2, coming in at $119 million for the second quarter. Earnings were negative in Q1, but quickly recovered and turned positive in Q2, coming in at 8 cents per share- the highest earnings the company has seen in over two years.Share prices have predictably grown as Calix beat the macro trends on sales and earnings. The stock is up an impressively robust 157% year-to-date.5-star analyst Richard Valera, of Needham, sees Calix as a long-term choice for investors, so much so that he has initiated coverage of the stock with a Buy rating and a $25 price target that suggest a 21% upside for the stock.

Shares are selling for $20.85, and the $25.50 average price target implies a one-year upside of 24%. (See CALX stock analysis on TipRanks)Gores Metropoulos (GMHI)Next on our list, Gores Metropoulos, is an associated company of the Gores Group. GMHI is a blank check company, existing to effect corporate mergers and capital exchanges, by acquisition of assets, stocks, and other business recombinations. Gores Metropoulos focuses on diversity in its portfolio, conducting acquisitions and management of companies in the business services, consumer products, healthcare, industrial, tech, and telecom segments.GMHI\u2019s most recent merger agreement is with Luminar, a company in the autonomous vehicle sector. The agreement was completed this past August and was valued at nearly $3 billion. Under the terms, Luminar gets a cash infusion of $400 million, and begins trading on the NASDAQ. This example is typical of GMHI\u2019s transactions.Analyst Gus Richard, covering this stock for Northland Securities, is impressed by the potential of the Luminar agreement. The possibilities induced him to initiate coverage of the stock.\u201cLARZ has developed an inexpensive lidar system design for the automotive market.
