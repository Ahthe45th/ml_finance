Yet, after already bidding up the stock at the end of 2020, much of what\u2019s coming up has likely been factored into its share price. That\u2019s clear from its current valuation. (See ROKU Stock Analysis on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nAdd in the fact that competition is heating up in the streaming arena, and it\u2019s understandable why investors have taken such an \u201con the fence\u201d view. For now, this mixed sentiment could continue.\n\n\n\nThe company may be making the right moves. Nevertheless, until investors start seeing tangible positive results from its further expansion, investors will remain hesitant to bid up shares much higher from today\u2019s prices (around $347 per share).\n\n\n\nROKU Stock and Streaming Competition\n\n\n\nRoku may have made a name for itself as a purveyor of streaming devices. On the other hand, in order to stay ahead of tech-based rivals like Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), it knows it has to offer up more than just streaming devices, and an ad network for third-parties.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s why Roku has been making a big push into streaming content as of late. This includes its purchase of failed streaming app Quibi\u2019s content library, as well as its deal to stream new releases from independent studio Saban Films.\n\n\n\nAt a time where Amazon is cutting big checks to secure content (its $9 billion deal to buy MGM), and content giants are planning to merge, like the pending WarnerMedia/Discovery (DISCA) deal, will Roku\u2019s efforts be enough?\n\n\n\nOnly time will tell. As its valuation remains sky-high, and investors take a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach, it may be difficult for shares in the near-term to move much higher from today\u2019s prices.\n\n\n\nValuation Could Hold, But There\u2019s Little Room for Expansion\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s still uncertain whether Roku\u2019s push into content will pay off. Yet, that\u2019s not to say analysts aren\u2019t projecting high levels of growth in the coming year. Set to grow its revenues by 54.1% this year, estimates call for the top line to grow another 36.8% in 2022. Earnings are also set to explode over the next year. Estimated to earn 37 cents a share this year, its bottom line is expected to rise by 127.5% next year, to $1.02 per share.\n\n\n\nThis high level of growth is why the stock has managed to achieve and maintain such a high valuation. At today\u2019s prices, the stock sells for 12.2x estimated 2022 sales, and a staggering 338.7x 2022 earnings.\n\n\n\nGiven that its projected growth remains high, and there\u2019s a possibility its streaming expansion could result in better-than-expected results, ROKU stock may not be at risk of pulling back further on multiple contraction.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, could it see multiple expansion in the near future? Probably not. Already selling at a premium to not just its more diversified tech and entertainment industry rivals, but streaming pure plays like Netflix (NFLX) as well, it\u2019s questionable whether this is in the cards.\n\n\n\nWhat Analysts are Saying About ROKU Stock\n\n\n\nAccording to TipRanks, ROKU stock has a consensus rating of Strong Buy. Out of 18 analyst ratings, 15 rate it a Buy, 2 analysts rate it a Hold, and 1 analyst rates it a Sell.\n\n\n\nAs for price targets, the average analyst Roku price target today is $449.94 per share, implying around 29.7% in upside from today\u2019s prices. Analyst price targets range from a low of $300 per share, to a high of $560 per share.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBottom Line: Expect Investors to Continue Taking a \u2018Wait and See\u2019 Approach\n\n\n\nEven after its nearly 30% pullback from its February highs, Roku\u2019s future growth is still largely factored into its stock price. In order to wow investors once again and kick off a rebound back to prior highs, it needs to not only meet, but beat, expectations.\n\n\n\nBetter-than-expected results could be ahead if its recent aggressive push into content pays off. Until that happens, expect investors to continue taking a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach with ROKU stock.\n\n\n\nDisclosure: Thomas Niel held no position in any of the stocks mentioned in this article at the time of publication.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

Still, as the content subscription service\u2019s big media and big tech rivals bulk up, the streaming leader now faces additional challenges.\n\n\n\nAs is well-known, recent headline-making deals in streaming have included the proposed merger of AT&T\u2019s (T) WarnerMedia unit into Discovery Inc. (DISCA), as well as Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) recently-announced purchase of film studio MGM.\n\n\n\nThis development adds to the ground big media has gained when it comes to its own streaming services. ViacomCBS\u2019s (VIAC) Paramount+, as well of WarnerMedia\u2019s HBOMax are some recent examples. Put them together, and they may start to have a dramatic effect on Netflix\u2019s growth potential, both in the U.S. and in its overseas markets.\u00a0(See Netflix stock analysis on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nSo, what could this do to stock price performance going forward? Even with these headwinds, international growth may still be on the table. This could help shares, trading for around $492 per share today, to hold steady. Yet, if this \u201cgrow into its valuation\u201d catalyst fails to fully play out, the above-mentioned pressures could weigh down further on shares.\n\n\n\nNFLX Stock and The Impact of Big Media Consolidation\n\n\n\nHow will the recent media deals affect Netflix shares going forward? Sure, as some have pointed out, the Amazon-MGM tie up may do little to affect the streaming space. Even after the still-pending WarnerMedia-Discovery merger closes, this platform will remain at the top of the streaming heap.\n\n\n\nFor now, Netflix\u2019s ubiquitous service remains the leader by subscriptions worldwide (204 million). With Amazon\u2019s Prime Video (150 million) the second largest, big media\u2019s various streaming platforms are still far behind, with Disney\u2019s (DIS) Disney+ the only one coming close to hitting 100 million.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, even as it remains the streaming leader, this doesn\u2019t guarantee it will not impact its underlying growth, as well as the future growth of the NFLX stock price, going forward. As the company\u2019s pandemic tailwinds (which helped materially boost results in 2020) fade, the platform\u2019s growth both in the U.S. and overseas is slowing down.\n\n\n\nBased on sell-side projections of 2022, growth may still be at a level that allows Netflix to hold onto its current valuation. However, if the recent deal-making and rival streaming services launches result in its actual results falling short, this richly-priced stock could be at risk of pulling back.\n\n\n\nSlowing Growth May Mean Valuation Contraction\n\n\n\nRight now, even with the potential risks mentioned above, high growth remains on the menu for NFLX stock going into 2022. Sell-side estimates call for the company\u2019s revenue to grow around 15%, and its earnings to grow around 23.2%, next year.\n\n\n\nIf it lives up to these estimates, it may be sufficient to help the stock, today trading for a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 37.9x, hold steady at its present price levels. Yet, both estimates are far from being set in stone.\n\n\n\nWhy? Namely, with the pandemic wrapping up, Netflix\u2019s subscriber growth is again falling short of expectations. Fortunately, even with the rising competition, the company\u2019s annual content budget has yet to soar to a point where it threatens earnings growth, if revenue growth comes in less than expected.\n\n\n\nWith its content costs this year ($17 billion) the same as last year, earnings growth will still be outsized, even if the top grows at a much slower slip. Even so, if earnings fall short of 20%+ growth, it may be enough to contract Netflix\u2019s valuation. Perhaps that will be only a modest correction, but a move down to a forward P/E of 30x would still result in a double-digit decline from today\u2019s prices.\n\n\n\nWhat Analysts are Saying About NFLX Stock\n\n\n\nAccording to TipRanks, NFLX stock has a consensus rating of Moderate Buy. Out of 36 analyst ratings, 26 rate it a Buy, 6 analysts rate it a Hold, and 4 analysts rate it a Sell.\n\n\n\nAs for price targets, the NFLX average analyst price target today is $599.33 per share, implying around 21.7% in upside from today\u2019s prices. Analyst price targets range from a low of $340 per share, to a high of $720 per share.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBottom Line: Increased Competition Leaves Netflix Shares at Risk of Going Nowhere, or Lower, From Here\n\n\n\nNetflix may remain the leader of the streaming space, but its days of delivering above-average growth may be numbered. As its worldwide subscriber growth slows, top and bottom-line results going forward could fall short of the expectations currently priced into shares.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that NFLX stock is at risk of big declines. Yet, as more investors fear that upside is limited, shares may have a tough time getting back to their highs set earlier this year ($593.29 per share).\n\n\n\nDisclosure: Thomas Niel held no position in any of the stocks mentioned in this article at the time of publication.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

(DISCA) and its discovery+ media properties.In the companies' announcement released Monday morning, AT&T and Discovery said the combination will \"form one of the largest global streaming players,\" combining \"WarnerMedia's premium entertainment, sports and news assets with Discovery's leading nonfiction and international entertainment and sports businesses to create a premier, standalone global entertainment company.\"From AT&T's perspective, the deal will essentially split AT&T into two companies. Rump AT&T will receive $43 billion\u00a0\"in a combination of cash, debt securities, and WarnerMedia's retention of certain debt\" to help it become \"one of the best capitalized 5G and fiber broadband companies in\u00a0the United States.\" Meanwhile, AT&T's media properties (HBO, etc.) will spin off to join with Discovery to become a \"'pure play' content company [with] one of the deepest libraries in the world.\"This \"pure play\" company, yet to be named say the parties, will come into existence when the deal closes in mid-2022. Shortly thereafter, the parties anticipate the media company to boast $52 billion in annual revenue, \"adjusted EBITDA of approximately\u00a0$14 billion, and an industry leading Free Cash Flow conversion rate of approximately 60%\" (which appears to imply annual free cash flow on the order of $31.2 billion) once it has achieved its target of \"at least\u00a0$3 billion\u00a0in expected cost synergies annually.\"Unsurprisingly, it's the new-born media conglomerate that investors are fixating on today, with Barrington analyst James Goss, for example, lauding its \"vast assets in scripted plus unscripted\" television content, and its $20 billion in annual spending on new content.The combined company, says Goss, will include \"the top television studio in terms of output,\" \"the #2 film studio,\" and \"a suite of content spanning sports, news, family, scripted and unscripted content,\" boasting significant U.S. market share and also \"a substantial international presence\" that can \"reach consumers in over 200 countries globally.\" This would all make for, says Goss in a significant understatement, \"a highly attractive streaming product.\"Accordingly, even though current Discovery shareholders will control only 29% of the shares of the combined media company, Goss is reiterating his Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on Discovery shares, and his $50 price target on those shares. (To watch Goss' track record, click here)Speaking of those shares, Goss points out that one advantage of the merger will be significant simplification of Discovery stock, as \"the three-class Discovery common share structure [is] collapsed into one.\" This one class of Discovery stock, by the way, is on track to earn only $2.95 per share this year (down 8% from 2020, when most of the world's population as stuck at home watching TV). By 2022, however, the year of the merger, Goss anticipates that Discovery will be back on a growth path with or without HBO, et al, earning $3.50 per share and thus growing its profits nearly 19% year over year.In terms of DISCA's Street consensus, analysts are split almost right down the middle. Out of 15 total analyst ratings published in the last three months, 7 say Buy while 8 suggest Hold, making the consensus a Moderate Buy. In addition, the average price target of $47.71 amounts to ~39% upside potential.

AT&T stock fell 2.7% on Monday and dropped a further 4.27% in extended-hours trading. Discovery stock dropped 5.05% on Monday.AT&T primarily provides telecom services and operates one of the largest wireless networks in the U.S. It bought Time Warner for $85.4 billion in a deal closed in June 2018, as it sought to branch into the media and entertainment business. AT&T then rebranded its entertainment division as WarnerMedia. In a restructuring move, AT&T is combining WarnerMedia with Discovery to form a new publicly traded media company.

Plus, they will get a stake in the new company, a global media leader that can build one of the top streaming platforms in the world,\u201d said AT&T CEO John Stankey.AT&T and Discovery expect the merger to create a global leader in streaming services while simultaneously cutting costs and increasing revenue. They estimate an annual cost savings of $3 billion. Additionally, the combined media company is projected to generate $52 billion in revenue in 2023 and deliver $14 billion in adjusted EBITDA. \u00a0The increased cash flow will fund further investments in its content and digital realms, as well as the company's direct-to-consumer advertising activities. If all goes as planned, the transaction will close in mid-2022, and Discovery President and CEO David Zaslav will lead the combined company.AT&T anticipates that the WarnerMedia spinoff will boost its capital structure and allow it to invest more in its telecom business.

It is unclear what the the structure of the deal might look like, but such a merger could create an entertainment colossus. AT&T owns CNN, HBO, Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT and the Warner Bros. studio.

Any deal would mark a major shift in AT&T\u2019s strategy after years of working to assemble telecommunications and media assets under one roof. AT&T gained some of the biggest brands in entertainment through its acquisition of Time Warner Inc., which was completed in 2018.The deal would underscore the difficulty telecom companies like AT&T and Verizon Communications Inc. have had finding a payoff from their media operations. Through its WarnerMedia unit, AT&T owns CNN, HBO, Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT and the Warner Bros. studio. Discovery, backed by cable mogul John Malone, controls networks such as HGTV, Food Network, TLC and Animal Planet.Chief Executive Officer David Zaslav has helped Discovery grow through acquisitions, including a purchase of HGTV owner Scripps Networks Interactive Inc. that closed in 2018. Discovery\u2019s class A shares have risen more than 18% this year, valuing the company at almost $24 billion. AT&T has gained 12%, giving it a market capitalization of $230 billion.The companies are still negotiating the structure of a transaction, and details could change or the talks could fall apart, the people said. Representatives for AT&T and Discovery declined to comment.Selling AssetsAT&T CEO John Stankey has been cleaning house at the sprawling telecom titan, cutting staff and selling underperforming assets. The company has been funneling money into rolling out its 5G wireless network, which requires billions of dollars of investment, as well as expanding its fiber-optic footprint.The carrier has been boosting movie and television production to attract subscribers to its HBO Max streaming service. It also needs cash to pay down debt. AT&T became one of the world\u2019s most indebted companies after an acquisition spree, and though it\u2019s been paying down what it owes, it now has bills from a recent spectrum auction.Any move involving AT&T\u2019s content assets would come just months after it reached a deal to spin off its DirecTV operations in a pact with buyout firm TPG. AT&T also agreed in December to sell its anime video unit Crunchyroll to a unit of Sony Corp. for $1.2 billion.And the company has parted with its Puerto Rico phone operations, a stake in Hulu, a central European media group and almost all its offices at New York\u2019s Hudson Yards.Stankey\u2019s predecessor at AT&T, longtime CEO Randall Stephenson, spent his 13-year tenure bulking up the company. He was obsessed with deals and kept a color-coded roster of companies he wanted AT&T to buy, leading to 43 acquisitions.But critics such as activist investor Elliott Management Corp. have complained about the strategy, urging AT&T to focus on its core business. And now that\u2019s just what Stankey is doing.In wireless services, AT&T is playing catch-up with Verizon, the market leader, and T-Mobile US Inc., which became the No. 2 carrier after gobbling up Sprint Corp. Verizon has made its own efforts to slim down. The company agreed this month to sell its media division to Apollo Global Management Inc. for $5 billion, a move that will offload online brands like AOL and Yahoo.The Discovery deal could give the combined company enough programming to compete with Netflix and other streaming services in a global battle over the future of entertainment. In 2019, Disney bought 21st Century Fox Inc.\u2019s entertainments assets for $71 billion, largely to gain enough muscle to constantly refresh its streaming services. It launched Disney+ in November 2019 and already has more than 100 million subscribers.Both Discovery and AT&T\u2019s media unit, WarnerMedia, have recently made their own forays into streaming. Discovery has debuted Discovery+, which has a vast array of unscripted reality shows. AT&T, meanwhile, has made a big bet on HBO Max, which launched a year ago and includes HBO programming and movies from AT&T\u2019s Warner Bros. studio. Both companies are quickly expanding their streaming services around the world.Cable NetworksDiscovery and WarnerMedia also own a portfolio of cable channels that remain profitable but are losing subscribers as more people abandon pay-TV service and adopt streaming. And AT&T\u2019s CNN is looking for new ways to maintain its audience after the busy news cycle of the Trump years. TNT and TBS have some general entertainment shows, but their most attractive assets may be their sports rights to air professional baseball, basketball and hockey. Discovery, meanwhile, has the rights to broadcast the Olympics and professional golf outside the U.S.Combining such assets would be complex, as the two companies have numerous long-term deals in place with pay-TV companies. A merged company would also have to choose a leader between WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar and Discovery\u2019s Zaslav.The deal would be an acknowledgment by AT&T that it hasn\u2019t delivered on the promise of owning distribution and media assets. The strategy has been criticized before, with analysts suggesting the two could be more valuable if kept separate.\u2018Fool\u2019s Gold\u2019Rich Greenfield, an analyst at LightShed Partners, has argued that AT&T and Comcast Corp., the cable provider that owns NBCUniversal, should spin off their media assets and combine them in a new company. He has called the promise of owning distribution and programming \u201cfool\u2019s gold.\u201dOn Sunday, Greenfield tweeted that he could \u201ccertainly imagine the secularly declining Turner assets merged with Discovery for scale,\u201d but added that it was \u201charder to imagine\u201d HBO Max and AT&T\u2019s Warner Bros studio being part of a combined company.At an investor conference last week, WarnerMedia\u2019s Kilar defended the need for WarnerMedia to be owned by AT&T, saying the telecom company had invested billions of dollars in HBO Max and broken down silos within the company to create a single operating unit. He added that AT&T\u2019s phone and broadband customers were less likely to cancel if they got HBO Max, and many of HBO Max\u2019s subscribers were AT&T customers.Kilar irked the Hollywood establishment with his decision in December to release all of WarnerMedia\u2019s movie slate on HBO Max at the same time the films hit theaters. But its recent movies have performed well at the box office, helping soothe concerns.Now he may face a more daunting challenge: helping piece together a patchwork of media businesses to create a new entity that can thrive in the streaming age.(Updates with with spectrum auction in eighth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=dba0c9359e218afa4877ff9db4810ea69425202a0ec7120c006732a5c9093096"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1621176448, "headline": "AT&T, Discovery in talks to combine content assets - Bloomberg News", "id": 67868950, "image": "https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20210516&t=2&i=1562293034&r=LYNXNPEH4F05Z", "related": "DISCA", "source": "Reuters", "summary": "Wireless carrier AT&T Inc is in talks to combine content assets with Discovery Inc, Bloomberg reported https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-16/at-t-is-said-in-talks-to-combine-content-assets-with-discovery-kor6r2uj on Sunday, citing people with knowledge of the...", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=97306be43c36a10fa72de002a82418a24b74d941c0f42e9ef897c7414481662d"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1621176447, "headline": "UPDATE 2-AT&T close to deal to combine media empire with Discovery-reports", "id": 67871015, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "related": "DISCA", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "U.S. telecoms giant AT&T Inc is nearing a deal to combine its media assets, including CNN and HBO, with Discovery Inc, the owner of lifestyle TV networks such as HGTV and TLC, according to news reports citing unnamed sources.

Bloomberg reports that the deal paves the way for Discovery to make many of its popular shows available exclusively on Hulu's live-TV service, citing unidentified sources. According to Bloomberg, Hulu has both a live service, intended to replace cable TV, and an on-demand service. All of Discovery's cable channels will continue to be broadcast on Hulu's live service. At the same time, Discovery will pull off some shows including, \"90 Day Fiance\u201d and \u201cFixer Upper\u201d from Hulu's on-demand service, and broadcast them exclusively on its new streaming platform, Discovery+.According to the report, Discovery has secured rate increases from Hulu in order to air some of its shows. (See Discovery stock analysis on TipRanks).\u00a0The new agreement with Hulu underscores how media giants are increasingly shunning cable networks, instead opting to stream content on their own. The net effect has been people cutting the cable cord in favor of streaming networks.\u00a0Yet Bloomberg reports that the cable business continues to provide the much-needed financing that is helping some of the media companies fund new streaming services. This explains why Hulu offers both on-demand service and cable TV replacement package.Barrington Research analyst James C. Goss has reiterated a Buy rating on Discovery. He is impressed by the growth of direct-to-consumer (DTC) subscribers to 15 million in Q1 2021.\u201cGrowing consumer awareness of the service supported by the company\u2019s marketing efforts are important for driving adoption. The growth of this product opens up high-value ad inventory as well as working to improve overall subscriber trends, while boosting subscription revenue growth,\u201d Goss wrote in a research note to investors.However, the analyst has cut the price target to $50, implying 36.91% upside potential to current levels.Consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 6 Buys, 8 Holds, and 1 Sell ratings. The average analyst price target of $48.29 implies 32.23% upside potential to current levels.DISCA scores a 6 out of 10 on TipRanks\u2019 Smart Score rating system, implying its performance is likely to align with market averages.Related News:Twitter Acquires Scroll and Opens Space To Enhance CommunicationFord Increases Investment In Solid-State Battery Startup, Solid PowerIntel Announces Massive Investments In Improving Its Products", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=77e557a58f29b32a9a8ab33c09dd5f425a02bf2876159d643c2f25e99347c9db"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620182640, "headline": "fuboTV Is a Small Fish in a Big Pond", "id": 67601337, "image": "https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/fubo_stock.jpg", "related": "DISCA", "source": "InvestorPlace", "summary": "FuboTV reports earnings and subscriber numbers May 11, with ambitions to be a live sportsbetting powerhouse.

Total subscribers to all of the company\u2019s streaming outlets stand at 15 million, Discovery said Wednesday, having crossed 13 million at the end of the first quarter.That\u2019s up from 5.2 million in December, before the U.S. launch of Discovery+, and about 12 million in February. But investors hoped for more, conditioned to torrid growth from the likes of Walt Disney Co.\u2019s Disney+.Discovery doesn\u2019t disclose subscribers specifically for Discovery+ but has said they\u2019re the majority of the company\u2019s direct-to-consumer customers. The company has smaller streaming services targeting areas such as golf and cooking.Elsewhere, Discovery\u2019s U.S. advertising sales fell 4% in the first quarter, with the company citing lower ratings \u201cand to a lesser extent secular declines in the pay-TV ecosystem and lower inventory.\u201dDiscovery shares fell as much as 8.8% to $35.56 in New York trading Wednesday. The stock remains up about 55% for the past year despite wild fluctuations: It rose sharply at the start of 2021, then shed nearly half its market value after the investment firm Archegos Capital Management was forced to liquidate its equity positions.Geetha Ranganathan, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, cited \u201cvery weak advertising and Discovery+ sub growth slowing\u201d as driving the stock declines Wednesday.Taking a rosier view, Wells Fargo analysts led by Steven Cahall said in a note that Discovery\u2019s 15 million in total streaming subscribers are close to the firm\u2019s estimate of 16 million for the second quarter. \u201cWe\u2019d say the sub performance is in line to ahead of expectations,\u201d they wrote.Earnings of 21 cents a share missed analysts\u2019 consensus expectation of 63 cents.

Between Feb. and March, value investors could not explain Discovery stock breaking out to a high of $78.14. Source: Iftekkhar / Shutterstock.com Only after Archegos Capital imploding on Mar. 28 did markets fully comprehend what drove Discovery shares to unsustainable highs. The firm, a family office run by Bill Hwang, took a leveraged bet by buying both Discovery stock and ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC). After selling $20 billion worth of stocks to cover its margin call, Discovery has yet to recover. What should investors who bought at the highs do next?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Discovery Stock in Freefall For a brief moment of no more than a month, Discovery shares, after breaking through the 50-day and 200-day moving average, found support at $35.00. Selling resumed when investors decided to minimize further losses. At a forward price-to-earnings ratio of around 10 times, value investors may start buying from here. Yet if history repeats itself, shares may fall below the 5-year trading range of $22 \u2013 $33 a share. 7 Retail Stocks With E-commerce Locked In Multiple block trades that sent Discovery shares lower are allegedly lower. No one knows for share. Markets may ignore the company\u2019s fundamentals until the trading uncertainties ease. Besides, the fourth-quarter results are fine but not great. In Q4, Discovery posted a lack of revenue growth at $2.89 billion. Despite U.S. advertising revenue flat and distribution revenue up 5%, international networks dragged on results. Potential Catalysts The company\u2019s launch of Discovery+ with Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is a step in the right direction. Yet the streaming content market is very crowded, dominated by many players. This includes Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney (NYSE:DIS). Discovery reported the total share of viewing across its international portfolio rose by 4% Y/Y. The six consecutive quarters of share growth suggests a sustained momentum ahead. It boasted over 11 million total paying direct-to-consumer subscribers globally. Management proved that its investments in Discovery+ are paying off. As it scales the service, profit margins will expand. The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic is a positive contributor to Discovery+ growth. That is also a risk factor in the medium term. Many States in the U.S. vaccinated half of the residents. As each State achieves herd immunity, lockdowns will ease. People will go outdoors and will socialize. That includes going to the movies. The pivot away from streaming to other traditional channels is a risk factor for Discovery. Fair Value Investors may look to Wall Street to get an idea on what Discovery shares are worth. Yet only one analyst offered a price target of $43.00 on Discovery, over two months ago (per Tipranks). On simplywall.st, the site figured that based on future cash flow, the stock is worth around $80.00. Readers may refer to a five-year discounted cash flow model (Gorden Growth Exit) model. Based on the assumptions below, the stock has a fair value of around $37.00. Metrics Range Conclusion Discount Rate 10.0% \u2013 9.0% 9.50% Perpetuity Growth Rate 0.0% \u2013 0.5% 0.00% Fair Value $33.72 \u2013 $42.55 $36.63 Interactive Model courtesy of finbox Readers may raise the growth rate forecast to come up with a higher price target. Given the pressures ahead, revenue growth of around 3% \u2013 5% annually is already an optimistic scenario. President and Chief Executive Officer David Zaslav said, \u201cOur unmatched global scale and ability to serve consumers everywhere with a truly differentiated offering across platforms, as well as our robust cash flows, even amidst the significant investments in our next generation initiatives.\u201d Unfortunately for income investors, the company is not sharing the robust cash flow through dividend payments. ViacomCBS pays a 96-cent annual dividend. This token payment will earn investor confidence in the competing firm\u2019s potential. ViacomCBS may simultaneously grow its content, build its online streaming service offering and still reward investors with regular dividend income. Your Takeaway Discovery may face months of selling pressure. The stock has plenty of overhang from speculators who bought shares on the way up. Those shareholders may take any small rally to sell shares. Netflix and other streaming services firms are attractive alternative investments.

The trades follow a torrent of similar transactions that had already erased about $194 billion in market value as banks from New York to Zurich and Tokyo unwound leveraged equity bets by Bill Hwang\u2019s family office.Shares of Credit Suisse fell as the sale adds to evidence that the Archegos collapse could impact the bank beyond the first quarter, when it took a 4.4 billion franc ($4.8 billion) writedown, its worst trading hit in more than a decade. While the Swiss bank has substantially reduced its exposure, transactions since the end of March weren\u2019t included in the first-quarter results, a person familiar with the matter has said.Credit Suisse fell as much as 2.2% in early Zurich trading and was 1.2% lower by 9:43 a.m. The stock has lost 15% this year, compared with double-digit gains for an index that includes its European peers.A spokesperson for Credit Suisse declined to comment on the sale and whether the bank plans more such transactions.Hwang\u2019s private investment firm became the center of one of the biggest margin calls of all time late last month, and represented one of the most spectacular failures of risk-management and oversight in recent memory. The downfall of Archegos will result in $10 billion of losses to banks, according to analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. The debacle could attract regulatory scrutiny and potential fines for the banks involved, the analysts said this week.Read more: Archegos Ripples Through Banks\u2019 Lucrative Hedge Fund BusinessTuesday\u2019s block trades -- which sold at the lower end of ranges -- included 19 million Class A shares of Discovery sold at $38.40, said one of the people, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter. In addition, 22 million Class C shares of Discovery sold at $32.35 while a stake of 35 million Iqiyi shares went for $15.85.Credit Suisse\u2019s latest sale comes weeks after several rivals dumped their shares to skirt losses. While the firm was one of several global investment banks to facilitate the leveraged bets of Archegos, it was slower than others to unwind the positions and had initially tried to reach some sort of standstill agreement, people familiar with the matter have said.The strategy failed as rivals rushed to cut their losses. Global banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG have told investors that they shed their Archegos-linked positions with little financial impact.Credit Suisse is now planning a sweeping overhaul of its hedge fund business. It has already announced plans to cut its dividend, suspend share buybacks and scrap bonuses for top executives.(Updates with Credit Suisse shares from third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a1f4f181b646494161d6a61e650a47bf88b4f1d636bead69a6c062b270b35ffa"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1618387140, "headline": "Fly Intel: Pre-market Movers GALT;BRY;FOLD;GS;LOVE;BBBY;INFY;DISCA;IQ;SFIX", "id": 66244215, "image": "https://image.thefly.com/catalog/202004/img_793.jpg", "related": "DISCA", "source": "Thefly.com", "summary": "<p>Check out this morning's top movers from a...", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3894524b67c281476feaf16fb73d1d394fd6f357a20cda671b753e94a9adb602"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1618386720, "headline": "Short Interest Through the End of March", "id": 66267938, "image": "", "related": "DISCA", "source": "TalkMarkets", "summary": "Content", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e7a23b8c078febadef65f0a6fd8c3394dfd5358d5c6dfffc54774c797cffd5c3"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1618385940, "headline": "Goldman Sachs Rises Premarket; JPMorgan and Bed Bath & Beyond Fall By Investing.com", "id": 66330874, "image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED3H1E9_L.jpg", "related": "DISCA", "source": "Investing.com", "summary": "Goldman Sachs Rises Premarket; JPMorgan and Bed Bath & Beyond Fall", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=2510619affb5f57a0aa9349334646aedbc42a5dd236fdd7cb376a2743304d5c6"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1618382760, "headline": "Discovery 19M share Block Trade priced at $38.40", "id": 66416160, "image": "", "related": "DISCA", "source": "Thefly.com", "summary": "Discovery 19M share Block Trade priced at $38.40 DISCA", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c48522f6cefc2120e2599a78723acf7d7abb8da85257f9669c89a9f6bd902e9e"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1618382262, "headline": "Wall Street Breakfast: Coinbase In Your Face", "id": 66139195, "image": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "related": "DISCA", "source": "SeekingAlpha", "summary": "Listen on the go!

With that scenario now discarded, and with the dust from the Archegos blowup settling, analysts are saying investors should look at some of these names again.\u201cUsually these dislocations where you get forced selling for non-fundamental reasons work out to be very good buying opportunities,\u201d said Greg Taylor, chief investment officer at Toronto-based Purpose Investments. \u201cThe counter to that is having to figure out how much of the runup was due to the buying that shouldn\u2019t have been there either. So you have balance that both out.\u201dRead more: Block-Trade Bevy Wipes $35 Billion Off Stock Values in a DayTake ViacomCBS for example.Until late in March, the company was among the top performing stocks in the benchmark S&P 500 Index, alongside Discovery, boosted in part by optimism over its streaming strategy but also thanks to a massive play by Bill Hwang\u2019s Archegos. The fund at one point amassed $10 billion worth of ViacomCBS shares and colossal positions in a few other companies.Read more: Bill Hwang Was a $20 Billion Whale, Then Lost It All in Two DaysSince Archegos\u2019 blowup and after a 52% drop in ViacomCBS\u2019s stock over the course of a week -- which in turn brought its valuation down by over 50% from a peak on March 22 -- at least six research firms have raised their ratings on the company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.At Wolfe Research, analyst John Janedis said in a note that ViacomCBS shares are now a buy opportunity as the media company\u2019s valuation appeared attractive after its selloff. He also pointed to its streaming business as a potential tailwind.A similar view is also behind Deustche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft\u2018s decision this week to raise Discovery\u2019s 12-month forecast to $60 from $35. The company\u2019s improved growth outlook warrants a higher valuation, he noted. Farfetch also got a \u201cbuy\u201d recommendation from JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth on Thursday, who said the stock delivers a \u201ccompelling buying opportunity.\u201dNo BargainsWhile the stocks caught at the center of the Archegos crisis are definitely hurting, they aren\u2019t exactly cheap. Their average price-to-earnings ratio -- a measure which indicates how expensive a company is -- is in line with the 10-year median, which signals how high valuations had gotten before the selloff. Aside from ViacomCBS, Discovery and Farfetch, Chinese companies like GSX Techedu Inc., Tencent Music Entertainment Group, Baidu Inc., VipShop Holdings Ltd. and IQiyi Inc. were also caught in the crosshairs of Archegos.Determining whether the selloff has turned a once-overvalued stock into a good buy will require some digging, said Barry Schwartz, chief investment officer at Baskin Wealth Management.\u201cIf you\u2019ve studied the company and you understand the business and you see this price drop as overdone, then take that opportunity to buy their shares,\u201d Schwartz said by phone. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t done your homework and you\u2019re thinking this is another GameStop situation, you\u2019re going to be the sucker at the table.\u201dFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=61a4370029b9232ed87c16512ea705aacb6a6848b07ecbc7b8df596589209440"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1618013340, "headline": "W.R.

The rally caused the price of the securities to come untethered from Discovery\u2019s more popular A class of stock.The cause of the jump was unclear. Very few Class B shares are available for trading -- only about 320,000, by Bloomberg\u2019s calculations -- and about three times as many changed hands on Wednesday. The stock, which has been rallying away from the Class A shares all week, touched a record high at $150.72 earlier in the session, a 115% gain at one point. In contrast, Class A shares were little changed at $43.46.It didn\u2019t stop there.Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings Inc. and Liberty Global Plc saw trading in their super voting share classes also halted for upticks in volatility. The common thread?: All of the stocks are low float, super voting shares tied to billionaire John Malone\u2019s empire.Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader and head of markets structure at Bright Trading, said the divergence in the trading of Discovery\u2019s Class B and Class A shares could be an extreme example of what he calls an \u201carb squeeze,\u201d or a short squeeze involving arbitrage traders.Dick said the moves could be an indication that arbitrage traders were turning to the more thinly traded shares for Discovery after not being able to borrow against the Class A shares.\u201cMaybe some arbs are short one class and long the other, but then the position gets too big and they\u2019re unable to get out, prompting a squeeze on the one class,\u201d Dick said.Liberty Media and Discovery representatives didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.The volatile trading comes after Discovery Class A shares suffered their biggest drop ever on March 26 as the media company was one of the stocks to see a block trade related to the forced liquidation of positions linked to Bill Hwang\u2019s Archegos Capital Management.Discovery Class A shares had previously been among the top performers on the S&P 500 Index this year as the stock rallied on investor optimism for the company\u2019s streaming service, Discovery+.\u201cThere is a share class trade involving Discovery, but that concerns the Class A and Class C shares, not the Class B, which generally doesn\u2019t trade as it is almost completely owned by John Malone,\u201d said United First Partners analyst Ivan Deryugin.Just 0.6% of Discovery Class B floating shares were held short as of Wednesday, according to data compiled by financial analytics firm S3 Partners. Short interest as a percentage of the float stood at about 31% in the more liquid Class A shares, roughly in line with where it has stood for much of the past year.Share classes differ in several ways, including voting rights: B shares carry more than the A shares. The issues\u2019 ownership profile is the other main difference. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, cable TV tycoon Malone controls about 94% of the B class -- the reason for the low float.Around 1:40 p.m. in New York, volatility also spread to the B shares for Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings Inc. and Liberty Global Plc. Both were subject to multiple halts after surging as much as 135% and 42%, respectively.A surprise spike in the price of Liberty TripAdvisor and Discovery\u2019s closely held shares isn\u2019t without precedent.Liberty TripAdvisor shares surged 30% in a single day of trading last April and Discovery\u2019s B shares gained 24% on May 1. Back then the two companies put out similar press releases with each saying they were \u201cnot aware of the reasons for the recent volatility\u201d in each of the share classes.(Adds details on other Malone related stocks, close prices)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=eb98f39dcb302e41d96f5c5ca19beca78ba9c02ea85ac53a91e7170c33c916e7"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1617219000, "headline": "This Soaring Nasdaq Stock Is Proof That the Market Is Broken", "id": 66387530, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fz87ipBzhoRv2yc61ozCmw--~B/aD0xMDU2O3c9MTQwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/6217aa9910cb0dc5d59846ef0615a580", "related": "DISCA", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "The stock market had a good day on Wednesday, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) in particular powered markets higher.

The American depositary receipts of Chinese companies also gained, with GSX Techedu Inc. boosted by a planned stock purchase by its chief executive officer, and Vipshop Holdings Ltd. helped by a $500 million buyback proposal.Shares in the companies, which also include Baidu Inc., Farfetch Ltd. and Iqiyi Inc., have had a rocky couple of sessions following the forced liquidation of positions linked to Bill Hwang\u2019s Archegos, with ViacomCBS down 55% in the five trading days through Monday. While investors remain nervous about the potential for more liquidations, there have been no signs yet of a broader contagion. The S&P 500 Index slipped about 0.3%.\u201cMarket participants will be glad to see this has so far been contained -- though there may be some more trades related to Archegos that need unwinding,\u201d Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said by email. \u201cBanks left holding the bag -- which look to be Nomura and Credit Suisse more than others -- will suffer significant losses.\u201dBanks roiled by the Archegos Capital fallout may see total losses in the range of $5 billion to $10 billion, according to JPMorgan.

The Swiss bank expects its loss tied to the implosion of Archegos Capital Management to run into the billions, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Credit Suisse fell about 3% in Zurich trading, taking its decline for the week to 16%. Nomura shed a further 0.7% in Tokyo, following Monday\u2019s 16% slump.Stocks valued at $2.64 billion changed hands in a flurry of block trades Monday. Five of them valued at a combined $2.14 billion were executed by Wells Fargo & Co., according to a person familiar with the matter.
