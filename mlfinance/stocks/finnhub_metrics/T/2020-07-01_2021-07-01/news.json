These companies are increasingly focusing on the deployment of 5G networks.\n\n\n\nUsing the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, we will compare two telecommunication companies, At&T and Verizon, and see how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAT&T (S&P 500 :T)\n\n\n\nAT&T is a global provider of telecommunications, media and technology services. The company has been in the news this year due to the divestiture of its assets. Earlier this year, the telecommunications giant announced the spin-off of its U.S. video operations and the formation of a new company, \u201cNew DirecTV,\u201d in partnership with private equity firm TPG Capital. The transaction was valued at $16.25 billion.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, last month, the company announced the spin-off of its WarnerMedia unit and the unit's merger with media company Discovery (DISCA). The spin-off would result in the formation of a new company wherein AT&T shareholders will own 71% of the combined company while Discovery will own the remaining 29%. The transaction will generate $43 billion for AT&T in cash and debt.\n\n\n\nAT&T is expected to report its second quarter results on July 22. AT&T\u2019s CFO, Pascal Desroches, updated the company\u2019s shareholders last week at the Credit Suisse Communications conference.\n\n\n\nDesroches stated, \u201c\u2026in the most recent quarters, AT&T\u2019s mobility strategy of focusing on the long-term value of its high-value customer base has been successful in reversing previous subscriber losses.\u201d\n\n\n\nRegarding WarnerMedia, it expects Q2 results to improve compared to the year-ago quarter, which was the worst hit by the pandemic. Desroches reiterated the planned international launch of HBO Max and and stated that he expects it to meet its guidance of 67 to 70 million HBO Max customers by the end of this year.\n\n\n\nThe company reaffirmed that the current dividend will not be reset before the completion of the WarnerMedia deal. However, Desroches added that after the completion of the deal, the dividend will deliver an attractive yield in the 95th percentile of the dividend-yielding stocks.\n\n\n\nAT&T had reduced the dividend payout ratio following the WarnerMedia spin-off and anticipates an annual dividend payout ratio between 40% to 43% on expected free cash flow in excess of $20 billion, following the close of the transaction.\n\n\n\nFollowing the WarnerMedia spin-off announcement, Raymond James analyst Frank Louthan reiterated a Buy on the stock. Louthan commented that the reduced dividend payout ratio implied \u201ca ~45% reduction in the AT&T dividend from current levels.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to Louthan, this was a deviation from the company\u2019s strategy of maintaining or growing its dividends and \u201cwill likely linger in investors' minds for many years.\u201d However, the analyst said that with the possibility of a dividend readjustment in the middle of next year, it \u201cwould see four more payments at current levels.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe CFO also said that the company is planning to accelerate the implementation of the C-Band spectrum (for 5G) and expects to cover 200 million people over the next two years. The company also plans to double its fiber footprint to around 30 million customer locations by the end of 2025.\n\n\n\nDesroches continues to expect AT&T\u2019s revenue CAGR to be in the low-single-digits over the long term from 2022 to 2024 and anticipates mid-single-digit adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS CAGR, subject to completion of the deal with WarnerMedia. (See AT&T stock chart on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nAnalyst Louthan commented on this outlook, \u201cWe remain positive on AT&T as we believe the simplification of the story and continued deleveraging create shareholder value, as both this deal and the prior decision to divest the DIRECTV platform exemplify.\u201d\n\n\n\nConsensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 7 Buys and 6 Holds. The average AT&T analyst price target of $32.17 implies approximately 12.3% upside potential to current levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerizon (S&P500: VZ)\n\n\n\nVerizon Communications is a provider of communications, technology, information and entertainment products and services that has two business segments, including Consumer Group and Business Group.\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s consumer business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, while the business segment provides data, video and conferencing services, corporate networking solutions and security and managed network services.\n\n\n\nVerizon is expected to announce its second quarter results on July 21. In Q1, the company posted revenues of $32.9 billion, with a year-over-year growth of 4% and an adjusted EPS of $1.31 per share.\n\n\n\nFor FY21, VZ expects wireless service revenues to grow by 3% year-over-year while services and other revenues are expected to rise by 2% year-over-year. The company expects adjusted EPS to land between $5 and $5.15 per share.\n\n\n\nThe company is increasingly focusing on the deployment of 5G with the combination of C-Band and millimeter wave spectrum.\n\n\n\nVerizon stated at its earnings call, \u201cOur intent is to invest $10 billion of incremental C-Band CapEx to accelerate the integration on this capacity into our network\u2026 We do expect C-Band-related capital spending to be between $2 billion to $3 billion for 2021\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nA couple of days back, the company\u2019s business segment launched its first commercial private 5G network solution in the U.S., allowing corporate and public sector customers to bring 5G services to their premises.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, the company kick-started its 5G upgrade campaign by offering customers a 5G-enabled mobile phone, in exchange for their old phones, on VZ\u2019s unlimited plan.\n\n\n\nVZ\u2019s existing customers could get a free iPhone (AAPL) 12 or Samsung Galaxy S21 5G-enabled phone with the switch. Following the 5G upgrade campaign, Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan reiterated a Hold on the stock.\n\n\n\nHoran said about the campaign, \u201cAs of last quarter, only ~7M of VZ subs have C-Band compatible devices. The focus is to migrate as many customers now onto compatible devices ahead of VZ deploying C-Band spectrum to 100M POPs [point of presence] by early 2022.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn addition Horan updated the financial model for the company and stated, \u201cLowering FY21 rev. and adj. EBITDA 20bps on adjusting the timing for TracFone [acquisition] but offset from higher equipment sales. We are raising postphone phone subs by 100K on volumes improving and the new promo should help.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn September last year, Verizon offered to buy TracFone, a unit of America Movil, for $6.3 billion. The deal has yet to get regulatory approval. TracFone is a wireless services reseller that provides wireless services under the government benefit program in select U.S. states and targets value and low-income segment users. (See Verizon stock chart on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nConsensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Hold based on 2 Buys and 8 Holds. The average Verizon analyst price target of $60.57 implies approximately 8.5% upside potential to current levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBottom Line\n\n\n\nIt is interesting to note here the analysts\u2019 take on the companies. According to Horan, VZ has the second largest wireline market share after AT&T.

The initial unemployment claims ticked up last week, even as the number of job openings reached a record high level. \n\n\n\nBetween the COVID relief bill, the infrastructure proposal, and a jobs act, the Biden Administration's spending plans are totaling $6 trillion. And with economic activity reopening after the COVID pandemic, consumers are getting out, eager to spend, and holding plenty of pent-up savings and demand. It should really be a simple story of economic expansion \u2013 and, yet, unemployment remains stubbornly high.\n\n\n\nHedge fund billionaire Paul Tudor Jones finds the situation disconcerting. Jones notes that the Fed can use the 9.3 million job openings as support for a policy shift away from stimulus, and goes on to say, \u201cIt\u2019s an intellectual incongruity that risks damaging their forecasts if they\u2019re wrong on inflation... At the same time, right now we\u2019re instead quantitative easing and juicing an economy that\u2019s already red hot... You\u2019ve got the craziest mix of fiscal and monetary policy since the Federal Reserve Board was created.\u201d\n\n\n\nWatching the markets from Canaccord, Chief Market Strategist Tony Dwyer believes that Jones is basically correct. \n\n\n\n\u201cUntil there is more clarity from the Fed or a more definable trend in the market, we would continue to have a 'do no harm' view, which means not making any significant market or sector bets until there is a more definable edge during the summer of indigestion,\u201d Dwyer noted.\n\n\n\nFor the average retail investor, this adds up to a picture of confusion. It also points toward defensive stock moves. And that will bring us to dividends. By providing a steady income stream, no matter what the market conditions, a reliable dividend stock provides a pad for your investment portfolio when the share stop appreciating.\n\n\n\nWith this in mind, we\u2019ve used the TipRanks database to pinpoint three reliable dividend stocks -- big dividend payers that are currently yielding over 7% and have a reputation for maintaining steady payments. Wall Street\u2019s analysts say that these are solid stocks to buy. Let's take a closer look.\n\n\n\nAltria Group (MO)\n\n\n\nThe first dividend stock we're looking at is known for generating mixed emotions. Altria is a tobacco seller, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, making MO a classic \u2018sin stock.\u2019 Altria is also well-known as one of the stock market\u2019s long-time dividend champs, with a 12-year history of dividend growth.\n\n\n\nWhile smoking is the subject of enormous social pressures, Altria\u2019s top line hasn\u2019t suffered much in recent years. Quarterly revenues, since 2018, have fluctuated at or near the $5 billion mark, with Q1 typically showing the lowest revenue and Q3 the highest. The company reported $4.88 billion in revenues in its last quarterly report, for 1Q21, solidly in the historical pattern. EPS came in at 77 cents, down 7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\n\n\nIn 1Q21, the company\u2019s dividend payments totaled $1.6 billion. The dividend itself was declared at 86 cents per common share, or $3.44 annually, and yields 7%.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that Altria\u2019s continued growth and profits come even as the FDA and Biden Administration are making noises about banning menthol cigarettes. These are popular products, and a ban would hurt Altria\u2019s bottom line \u2013 but for now, it appears that the company, investors, and cigarette consumers are all shrugging off the possibility. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to note here, on the subject of tobacco product bans, that Altria is heavily invested in promoting the iQOS smokeless tobacco system. This past December, Altria announced that it had received FDA approval for commercialization of iQOS3, the latest version of the product.\n\n\n\nCovering Altria for Piper Sandler, Michael Lavery notes the regulatory risks ahead, but believes that Altria can roll with it. \n\n\n\n\u201cWe expect headline risk to remain in place for some time, but note that Altria looks best positioned if menthol is banned; 20% of its volumes are from menthol, vs. ~55% for BAT. Altria's iQOS could benefit; over 50% of its US sales are from menthol, and it should be much more established by the time any menthol ban could come into place,\u201d Lavery opined.\n\n\n\nLavery rates MO shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and gives the stock a price target of $57. At current levels, this implies an upside of 19% for the year ahead. (To watch Lavery\u2019s track record, click here)\n\n\n\nOverall, Wall Street is pretty upbeat about the company. TipRanks analysis of 12 analyst ratings shows a consensus Moderate Buy rating, with 8 analysts Buying and four recommending Hold. The average price target is $54.40, indicating room for a 15% upside from the current trading price of $47.22. (See MO stock analysis on TipRanks)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOmega Healthcare (OHI)\n\n\n\nAnd now we move on to the healthcare sector, where Omega operates as a real estate investment trust (REIT) with a focus on skilled nursing facilities and senior housing facilities. The company\u2019s portfolio boats a total of 954 facilities, located in 42 US states and the UK. Of Omega\u2019s properties, 78% are skilled nursing facilities, and 22% are senior housing. The portfolio has delivered a total return of 232% over the past decade, and Omega has increased its dividend regularly since 2003.\n\n\n\nThe company funds the dividend with solid financial results. In Q1, Omega report $164.4 million in net income, or 69 cents per share. This was up significantly from the year-ago quarter, which saw EPS of 42 cents.\n\n\n\nSeveral other key metrics were strong in the quarter, too. Omega collected over 99% of the rent and mortgage payments due it. The company sold 24 properties for $188 million, generating a net gain of $100 million. And it made $595 million worth of new acquisitions to the portfolio. At the end of all that, Omega\u2019s \u2018funds available for distribution,\u2019 the money available to cover the dividend, came in at $193.2 million.\n\n\n\nTurning to the dividend, Omega declared 67 cents per common share for the quarterly payment. This is the seventh quarter in a row with the dividend at this level. With an annualized payment of $2.68, the yield is just over 7%. Compared to the current interest rates, or to the ~2% average dividend in the broader markets, this is a solid return.\n\n\n\nBerenberg analyst Connor Siversky notes that the receding COVID pandemic has eased the pressure on skilled nursing and senior housing facilities, and he writes of Omega: \u201cWe expect occupancy gains to accelerate modestly into the summer months as the care delivery system works through a backlog of prospective SNF patients. Given positive occupancy trends and a reemergence of investment activity, we believe OHI\u2019s shares will perform well versus peers in near term as investors weigh the velocity of the burgeoning SNF recovery.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn line with those comments, Siversky rates OHI shares as a Buy, and his $41 price target implies a one-year upside potential of 13%. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~20% potential total return profile. (To watch Siversky\u2019s track record, click here)\n\n\n\nOverall, five analysts have weighed in on Omega recently, and their reviews include 3 Buys and 2 Holds, giving the stock a Moderate Buy analyst consensus rating. OHI is currently priced at $36.15 and its average target of $41.25 suggests a 14% upside from that level. (See OHI stock analysis on TipRanks)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAT&T, Inc. (T)\n\n\n\nLast of our list of dividend champs is AT&T, one of the corporate world\u2019s most recognizable names. The company got its start at the dawn of telecommunications, became a telephone monopoly during the last century, and was broken up under anti-trust actions in the 1980s. The modern company, operating since 2005, is a telecom and tech giant, with a market cap of $209 billion and more than $170 billion in annual revenue.\n\n\n\nAT&T\u2019s current business is highly diversified, and based in communications. The company retains a telephone service division, for both local and long distance landlines, and is a major provider of broadband services over both fiber-optic and wireless networks. AT&T is part of the accelerating 5G rollout in the US. In recent years, AT&T purchased Time Warner, and uses that library of entertainment content to support its streaming TV ventures.\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s recent Q1 report shows a sound foundation for investors to consider. At the top line, revenues came in at $43.9 billion, for a modest 2.7% yoy gain. EPS performed better; at $1.04, the earnings per share increased 65% from the year-ago quarter. And of interest for dividend investors, the company showed increased cash flows \u2013 the source of all dividend payments. Cash from operations was up 12% to $9.9 billion, and the free cash flow increased 51%, to $5.9 billion.\n\n\n\nDuring the quarter, AT&T declared a common share dividend of 52 cents. This was the sixth consecutive quarter at this rate for T\u2019s dividend, which has a 12-year history\u00a0of regular growth. The annualized payment, at $2.08, gives a dividend yield of 7.1%.\n\n\n\nIn his research note on AT&T, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft states his belief that the company has sound prospects. \n\n\n\n\u201cManagement has been taking steps to improve the company's focus: (1) centering its strategy and investment around areas where it can leverage its scale and differentiated assets to grow revenue/cash flow and create value (including wireless, fiber-based broadband, and HBO Max), (2) while at the same time balancing profitability by implementing cost transformation initiatives, and (3) monetizing non-core businesses (including DirecTV and Crunchyroll) to help fund these growth investments, while reducing management distraction,\" Kraft wrote.\n\n\n\nThe analyst summed up, \"We believe that AT&T's more concentrated strategy, and more recent relentless focus on execution, should drive sustained improvement in the company's fundamentals. With the stock trading at a relatively undemanding valuation and an attractive dividend yield, we see the opportunity for a healthy mid-teens % return.\"\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, Kraft, wrote, \u201cWe believe that AT&T's more concentrated strategy, and more recent relentless focus on execution, should drive sustained improvement in the company's fundamentals. With the stock trading at a relatively undemanding valuation and an attractive dividend yield, we see the opportunity for a healthy mid-teens % return over the next 12 months.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe analyst uses these comments to support a Buy rating on T shares, along with a $34 price target that implies room for ~17% upside. (To watch Kraft\u2019s track record, click here)\n\n\n\nSo, that\u2019s Deutsche Bank's view, let\u2019s turn our attention now to rest of the Street: T's 7 Buys, 5 Holds and 2 Sell coalesce into a Moderate Buy rating. The stock is currently priced at $29.13 and its $32.17 average price target suggests it has a 10% upside ahead of it.

(See\u00a0AT&T stock charts\u00a0on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nAT&T will report its second-quarter 2021 results on July 22, before the market opens. The company reiterated its previous long-term guidance for 2022 - 2024 of low-single-digit revenue CAGR and mid-single-digit adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS CAGR, subject to completion of the deal with WarnerMedia.\n\n\n\nRegarding WarnerMedia, it expects Q2 results to improve compared to the year-ago quarter, which was the worst hit by the pandemic. The company is looking forward to the international launch of HBO Max and expects to meet its guidance of 67 to 70 million HBO Max customers by the end of 2021.\n\n\n\nThe company reaffirmed that the current dividend will not be reset before the completion of the WarnerMedia deal. However, Desroches added that after the completion of the deal, the dividend will deliver an attractive yield in the 95th percentile of the dividend-yielding stocks.\n\n\n\nDesroches commented that the company has successfully reversed previous subscriber losses driven by its mobility strategy of focusing on the long-term value of its high-value customer base.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, management remains confident of posting growth in post-paid subscribers based on current trends and reducing costs by transforming its distribution channels.\n\n\n\nAT&T will accelerate its deployment of the C-band spectrum and hopes to cover 200 million people by the end of 2023.\n\n\n\nMoving forward, it will also strengthen its network to keep up with the increasing demand for 5G and provide a higher average speed.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the company plans to double its fiber footprint to around 30 million customer locations by the end of 2025.\n\n\n\nNew Street analyst Jonathan Chaplin recently upgraded AT&T to Buy from Hold and increased the price target from $29 to $35 (19.5% upside potential).\n\n\n\nChaplin believes that the dividend cut and increase in capital expenditure should create incremental value for the company in the coming years. \n\n\n\nOverall, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 7 Buys, 5 Holds, and 2 Sells. The AT&T average analyst\u00a0price target of $32.27\u00a0implies 10.2% upside potential from current levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated News:Clean Energy Reveals Plans to Develop Natural Gas From Dairies; Shares RoarBentley Systems Snaps Up SPIDA to Accelerate its Grid ResilienceBank of America Expands Financial Centers in Kentucky", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=845be598fe1bbea15a22403d59dcedf911f33d4c10c8e414dc28741f0db5e2da"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1623848686, "headline": "Time To Weigh-In On AT&T", "id": 68304508, "image": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/965085346/medium_image_965085346.jpg", "related": "T", "source": "SeekingAlpha", "summary": "Recent AT&T management moves effectively repudiated the DirecTV and WarnerMedia acquisitions.\u00a0This is a bold statement.
