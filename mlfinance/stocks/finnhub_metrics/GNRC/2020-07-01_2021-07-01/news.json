(NYSE: GNRC) (\u201cGenerac\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a leading global designer and manufacturer of energy technology solutions and other power products, today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2021 and provided an update on its outlook for the full year 2021. First Quarter 2021 Highlights Net sales increased 70% to a record $807 million during the first quarter of 2021 as compared to $476 million in the prior-year first quarter. Core sales growth, which excludes both the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency, increased approximately 67%. Residential product sales more than doubled to $542 million as compared to $258 million last year, representing a 110% increase.Commercial & Industrial (\u201cC&I\u201d) product sales increased 18% to $202 million as compared to $172 million in the prior year. Net income attributable to the Company during the first quarter was $149 million, or $2.33 per share, as compared to $44 million, or $0.68 per share, for the same period of 2020.Adjusted net income attributable to the Company, as defined in the accompanying reconciliation schedules, was a record $153 million, or $2.38 per share, as compared to $55 million, or $0.87 per share, in the first quarter of 2020.Adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interests, as defined in the accompanying reconciliation schedules, was a record $214 million, or 26.5% of net sales, as compared to $86 million, or 18.1% of net sales, in the prior year.Cash flow from operations was $153 million, a record for the first quarter of a year, as compared to $11 million in the prior year. Free cash flow, as defined in the accompanying reconciliation schedules, was a record for a first quarter of $126 million as compared to ($1 million) for 2020. The substantially higher cash flow was primarily due to higher net income and a lower level of working capital investment in the current year quarter, which was partially offset by higher capital expenditures relative to the prior year quarter.The Company is increasing its full-year 2021 net sales guidance to now be approximately 40 to 45% growth compared to the prior year, which is an increase from the 25 to 30% previously expected. Adjusted EBITDA margin, before deducting for non-controlling interests, is now expected to be approximately 24.5 to 25.5%, which is an increase from the 24.0 to 25.0% previously expected. \u201cOur first quarter results continue to demonstrate the power of Generac\u2019s business model and the fantastic execution by our team as our revenue grew at a tremendous 70% rate to over $800 million, driving a significant increase in adjusted EBITDA margins. The revenue performance represents an all-time record despite the seasonally lower first-quarter time period,\u201d said Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer. \u201cGrowth was broad based led by a dramatic increase for home standby generators that more than doubled compared to prior year given the powerful mega trends that are driving incredible demand for these products.\u201d Jagdfeld continued, \u201cShipments of our PWRcell\u00ae energy storage systems also grew at a significant rate as compared to the prior year, and with the considerable momentum we have in the marketplace, we are increasing our outlook for these products for the remainder of the year. Shipments of C&I products returned to growth in the quarter, increasing at a strong rate as demand is recovering at a faster pace than previously expected across a number of markets and geographies. With the impact from the major outages in Texas along with further capacity expansion actions for home standby, and with demand strengthening broadly across the rest of the business, we are substantially increasing our full year revenue and earnings outlook for 2021.\u201d Additional First Quarter 2021 Consolidated Highlights Gross profit margin improved 370 basis points to 39.9% compared to 36.2% in the prior-year first quarter. The increase was primarily driven by favorable sales mix from significantly higher shipments of residential products, along with improved pricing and overhead absorption from higher sales volumes. These favorable impacts were partially offset by the onset of higher input costs primarily relating to raw materials, labor, freight and logistics costs. Operating expenses increased $23.2 million, or 21.2%, as compared to the first quarter of 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher variable expenses from the significant increase in sales volumes, higher employee costs and incentive compensation, and the impact of acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in controllable operating expenses. Provision for income taxes for the current year quarter was $35.4 million, or an effective tax rate of 19.1%, as compared to $9.4 million, or a 17.9% effective tax rate, for the prior year. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to the significant increase in the mix of domestic pretax income in the current year.Business Segment Results Domestic Segment Domestic segment sales increased 84.2% to $692.7 million as compared to $376.0 million in the prior year quarter, with the impact of acquisitions contributing approximately 2.0% of the revenue growth for the quarter. The core sales growth was primarily driven by a significant increase in shipments of residential products highlighted by home standby and portable generators. In addition, PWRcell\u00ae energy storage systems experienced healthy growth as the Company continues to expand in the clean energy market, and shipments of chore products also improved at a strong rate as compared to the prior year. This was supplemented by a return to growth for C&I products which was led by a substantial increase in shipments to telecom national account customers compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $207.1 million, or 29.9% of net sales, as compared to $82.8 million in the prior year, or 22.0% of net sales. This margin increase was driven by favorable sales mix, improved pricing and higher operating leverage from the substantial revenue growth for the segment during the quarter. International Segment International segment sales increased 14.8% to $114.7 million as compared to $99.9 million in the prior year quarter. Core sales, which excludes the favorable impact of currency, increased 9.6% compared to the prior year. The growth for the segment was due to an increase in market activity primarily in the European region that is now recovering from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic which began during the first quarter of the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment, before deducting for noncontrolling interests, was $7.1 million, or 6.2% of net sales, as compared to $3.3 million, or 3.3% of net sales, in the prior year. The improvement in margin was due to the combination of favorable sales mix, improved operating leverage on the higher sales volumes, and a reduction in certain controllable operating expenses. Updated 2021 OutlookThe major outages in Texas during the first quarter have led to an acceleration in demand and backlog for home standby generators from the already elevated levels that existed prior to this event. This has resulted in a further increase in capacity expansion plans and is leading to a significant increase in the shipment outlook for these products for the full-year 2021. Also contributing to the improved outlook for residential products is a notable increase in portable generator shipments, along with higher demand for PWRcell\u00ae energy storage systems due to further progress in building out distribution partners in this overall expanding market. The outlook for C&I products has also improved considerably due to a broad based rebound in demand highlighted by a significant pickup in activity from telecom national account customers, and overall stronger outlooks for domestic and international markets. As a result of these factors, the Company is increasing its full-year 2021 net sales growth guidance to now be approximately 40 to 45% compared to the prior year, which includes only approximately 2% of favorable impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. This is an increase from the as-reported growth guidance of 25 to 30% previously expected. Net income margin, before deducting for non-controlling interests, is now expected to be approximately 16.0 to 17.0% for the full-year 2021, which is an increase from the prior expectation of between 15.0 to 16.0%. The corresponding adjusted EBITDA margin is now expected to be approximately 24.5 to 25.5%, which is an increase from the 24.0 to 25.0% previously expected. Operating and free cash flow generation is still expected to be strong, with the conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow expected to be approximately 90%.

Forward-looking statements give Generac's current expectations and projections relating to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business.

These statements may include words such as \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"forecast,\" \"project,\" \"plan,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" \"confident,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"can have,\" \"likely,\" \"future,\" \u201coptimistic\u201d and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events. Any such forward looking statements are not guarantees of performance or results, and involve risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Company's control) and assumptions. Although Generac believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect Generac's actual financial results and cause them to differ materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements, including: frequency and duration of power outages impacting demand for our products;availability, cost and quality of raw materials and key components from our global supply chain and labor needed in producing our products;the impact on our results of possible fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodities, product mix and regulatory tariffs;the possibility that the expected synergies, efficiencies and cost savings of our acquisitions will not be realized, or will not be realized within the expected time period;the risk that our acquisitions will not be integrated successfully;the duration and scope of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are uncertain and may or will continue to adversely affect our operations, supply chain, and distribution for certain of our products and services;difficulties we may encounter as our business expands globally or into new markets;our dependence on our distribution network;our ability to invest in, develop or adapt to changing technologies and manufacturing techniques;loss of our key management and employees;increase in product and other liability claims or recalls;failures or security breaches of our networks, information technology systems, or connected products; andchanges in environmental, health and safety, or product compliance laws and regulations affecting our products, operations, or customer demand. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, Generac's actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in any forward-looking statements. In the current environment, some of the above factors have materialized and may or will continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which may cause actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of these and other factors that may affect future results is contained in Generac's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), particularly in the Risk Factors section of the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in its periodic reports on Form 10-Q. Stockholders, potential investors and other readers should consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements.

Non-GAAP Financial Metrics Core Sales The Company references core sales to further supplement Generac's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Core sales excludes the impact of acquisitions and fluctuations in foreign currency translation. Management believes that core sales facilitates easier and more meaningful comparison of net sales performance with prior and future periods. Adjusted EBITDA The computation of adjusted EBITDA attributable to the Company and adjusted EBITDA margin is based on the definition of EBITDA contained in Generac's credit agreement dated as of May 31, 2013, as amended. To supplement the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Generac provides a summary to show the computation of adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the impact of noncontrolling interests, taking into account certain charges and gains that were recognized during the periods presented. Adjusted Net Income To further supplement Generac's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company provides a summary to show the computation of adjusted net income attributable to the Company. Adjusted net income attributable to the Company is defined as net income before noncontrolling interests and provision for income taxes adjusted for the following items: cash income tax expense, amortization of intangible assets, amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount related to the Company's debt, intangible impairment charges, certain transaction costs and other purchase accounting adjustments, losses on extinguishment of debt, business optimization expenses, certain other non-cash gains and losses, and adjusted net income attributable to non-controlling interests. Free Cash Flow In addition, we reference free cash flow to further supplement Generac's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, plus proceeds from beneficial interests in securitization transactions, less expenditures for property and equipment, and is intended to be a measure of operational cash flow taking into account additional capital expenditure investment into the business. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

(NYSE: GNRC) (\u201cGenerac\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a leading global designer and manufacturer of energy technology solutions and other power products, today reported financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2020 and provided an update on its outlook for the full year 2020.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Third Quarter 2020 Highlights  * Net sales increased approximately 17% to $701 million during the third quarter of 2020 as compared to $601 million in the prior-year third quarter. Core sales growth, which excludes both the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency, increased approximately 16%.     * Residential product sales increased 37% to $459 million as compared to $335 million last year.    * Commercial & Industrial (\u201cC&I\u201d) product sales decreased 18% to $176 million as compared to $215 million in the prior year.\u00a0\u00a0  * Net income attributable to the Company during the third quarter was $115 million, or $1.82 per share, as compared to $76 million, or $1.18 per share, for the same period of 2019.  * Adjusted net income attributable to the Company, as defined in the accompanying reconciliation schedules, was $133 million, or $2.08 per share, as compared to $90 million, or $1.43 per share, in the third quarter of 2019.  * Adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interests, as defined in the accompanying reconciliation schedules, was $179 million, or 25.5% of net sales, as compared to $126 million, or 21.0% of net sales, in the prior year.  * Cash flow from operations was $155 million as compared to $111 million in the prior year. Free cash flow, as defined in the accompanying reconciliation schedules, was $148 million as compared to $101 million for 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volumes and resulting net income.  * The Company is increasing its full-year 2020 sales growth guidance to now be approximately 10 to 12% of year-over-year growth, which is an increase from the baseline growth guidance of 5 to 8% previously expected. Adjusted EBITDA margin, before deducting for non-controlling interests, is now expected to be approximately 22.5 to 23.0%, which is an increase from the 21.5 to 22.0% previously expected.  * On July 1st, 2020, the Company closed on the acquisition of Energy Systems, its industrial distributor located in Northern California.  * As previously announced on September 1st, 2020, the Company acquired the assets of Mean Green Products, LLC. Headquartered in Ross, Ohio, Mean Green is a leading manufacturer of an innovative commercial line of battery powered turf care products.  * On October 7th, we closed on the acquisition of Enbala Power Networks Inc. (\u201cEnbala\u201d). Based in Denver, Colorado, Enbala is one of the leading providers of distributed energy optimization and control software needed to ensure the operational stability of the world\u2019s power grids.\u201cThird quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA far exceeded all-time records led by dramatic growth in sales of home standby and portable generators,\u201d said Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer. \u201cPower outage activity was much higher during the quarter driven by more extreme and severe weather. When combined with the \u201cHome as a Sanctuary\u201d trend that we began seeing at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for home standby generators reached unprecedented levels during the quarter. Shipments of our PWRcell energy storage systems recovered during the third quarter and increased significantly from lower levels in the second quarter, which were impacted by a slowdown in solar installations due to the pandemic. As expected, our C&I products were also negatively impacted, however, we realized some meaningful benefits from our recent cost-reduction efforts that were initiated in the second quarter.\u201dJagdfeld continued, \u201cWe announced several strategic acquisitions in recent months that enable us to enter exciting new markets. In July, we closed on the acquisition of our industrial distributor in Northern California, Energy Systems, to enhance our ability to serve this very large, rapidly growing power generation market. In September, we entered the battery-powered commercial mower market with Mean Green Products, which will help accelerate the electrification of our chore products. In October, we entered the emerging market for \u201cgrid services\u201d through the acquisition of Enbala Power Networks, which plays into another secular trend involving the evolution of the traditional electric utility model and further advances our capabilities as an energy technology solutions company.\u201dAdditional Third Quarter 2020 Consolidated HighlightsGross profit margin improved 320 basis points to 39.4% compared to 36.2% in the prior-year third quarter. The increase was primarily driven by favorable sales mix from significantly higher shipments of residential products and a lower mix of C&I products.     Operating expenses increased $8.6 million, or 7.6%, as compared to the third quarter of 2019. The increase was primarily driven by incremental spend related to clean energy products and higher incentive compensation. These increases were partially offset by lower advertising and promotional costs, along with a reduction in operating expenses for the International segment as a result of restructuring actions initiated in the second quarter of 2020.Provision for income taxes for the current year quarter was $32.1 million, or an effective tax rate of 21.8%, as compared to $20.1 million, or a 21.1% effective tax rate, for the prior year. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to the prior year having more favorable discrete tax items compared to the current year quarter, which was partially offset by an overall more favorable mix of pretax income in the current year quarter.Business Segment ResultsDomestic SegmentDomestic segment sales increased 22.6% to $606.9 million as compared to $494.8 million in the prior year quarter. As a result of the heightened awareness of the need for backup power, shipments of home standby generators experienced very strong growth during the quarter. In addition, significant power outage activity also drove elevated shipments of portable generators and aftermarket service parts. Shipments of the recently launched PWRcell energy storage system also had a strong impact on growth following the expected recovery in the solar market during the third quarter. This residential products growth was partially offset by continued weakness in sales of C&I mobile products following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and lower oil prices.Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $171.4 million, or 28.2% of net sales, as compared to $120.8 million in the prior year, or 24.4% of net sales. This margin increase was driven by favorable sales mix and higher operating leverage from the significant revenue growth.International SegmentInternational segment sales decreased 11.1% to $94.5 million as compared to $106.3 million in the prior year quarter. The decline was driven by continued broad-based weakness in global C&I product demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0\u00a0Adjusted EBITDA for the segment, before deducting for noncontrolling interests, was $7.4 million, or 7.9% of net sales, as compared to $5.1 million, or 4.8% of net sales, in the prior year. Decreased operating leverage on the lower sales volumes was more than offset by lower operating expenses as a result of the restructuring activities initiated in the second quarter of 2020.Updated 2020 Outlook    Given the higher power outage environment thus far in second half of 2020, along with increased production rates in the fourth quarter for home standby generators, the Company is raising its prior guidance for revenue growth for full-year 2020, and now expects an increase of approximately 10 to 12% compared to the prior year. This compares to the previous baseline guidance of 5 to 8% revenue growth.As a result of the higher revenue expectations, net income margin, before deducting for non-controlling interests, is now expected to be approximately 13.0 to 13.5% for the full-year 2020, which is an increase from the prior expectation of between 12.0% to 12.5%. The corresponding adjusted EBITDA margin is now expected to be approximately 22.5 to 23.0%, which is an increase from the 21.5% to 22.0% previously expected.Conference Call and WebcastGenerac management will hold a conference call at 10:00 a.m. EDT on Wednesday, October 28, 2020 to discuss third quarter 2020 operating results.

Forward-looking statements give Generac's current expectations and projections relating to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"forecast,\" \"project,\" \"plan,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" \"confident,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"can have,\" \"likely,\" \"future,\" \u201coptimistic\u201d and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events.Any such forward looking statements are not guarantees of performance or results, and involve risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Company's control) and assumptions. Although Generac believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect Generac's actual financial results and cause them to differ materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements, including:  * frequency and duration of power outages impacting demand for our products;  * availability, cost and quality of raw materials and key components from our global supply chain and labor needed in producing our products;  * the impact on our results of possible fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodities, product mix and regulatory tariffs;  * the possibility that the expected synergies, efficiencies and cost savings of our acquisitions will not be realized, or will not be realized within the expected time period;  * the risk that our acquisitions will not be integrated successfully;  * difficulties we may encounter as our business expands globally or into new markets;  * our dependence on our distribution network;  * our ability to invest in, develop or adapt to changing technologies and manufacturing techniques;  * loss of our key management and employees;  * increase in product and other liability claims or recalls;  * failures or security breaches of our networks or information technology systems;  * changes in environmental, health and safety, or product compliance laws and regulations affecting our products or operations; and  * the duration and scope of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are uncertain and may or will continue to adversely affect our operations, supply chain, distribution, and demand for certain of our products and services.  Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, Generac's actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in any forward-looking statements. In the current environment, some of the above factors have materialized and may or will continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which may cause actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of these and other factors that may affect future results is contained in Generac's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), particularly in the Risk Factors section of the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in its periodic reports on Form 10-Q. Stockholders, potential investors and other readers should consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements.Any forward-looking statement made by Generac in this press release speaks only as of the date on which it is made.\u00a0 Generac undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.Non-GAAP Financial MetricsCore SalesThe Company references core sales to further supplement Generac's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Core sales excludes the impact of acquisitions and fluctuations in foreign currency translation. Management believes that core sales facilitates easier and more meaningful comparison of net sales performance with prior and future periods.Adjusted EBITDAThe computation of adjusted EBITDA attributable to the Company and adjusted EBITDA margin is based on the definition of EBITDA contained in Generac's credit agreement dated as of May 31, 2013, as amended. To supplement the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Generac provides a summary to show the computation of adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the impact of noncontrolling interests, taking into account certain charges and gains that were recognized during the periods presented.Adjusted Net IncomeTo further supplement Generac's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company provides a summary to show the computation of adjusted net income attributable to the Company. Adjusted net income attributable to the Company is defined as net income before noncontrolling interests and provision for income taxes adjusted for the following items: cash income tax expense, amortization of intangible assets, amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount related to the Company's debt, intangible impairment charges, certain transaction costs and other purchase accounting adjustments, losses on extinguishment of debt, business optimization expenses, certain other non-cash gains and losses, and adjusted net income attributable to non-controlling interests.Free Cash FlowIn addition, we reference free cash flow to further supplement Generac's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, plus proceeds from beneficial interests in securitization transactions, less expenditures for property and equipment, and is intended to be a measure of operational cash flow taking into account additional capital expenditure investment into the business.The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\u00a0 Please see the accompanying Reconciliation Schedules and our SEC filings for additional discussion of the basis for Generac's reporting of Non-GAAP financial measures, which includes why the Company believes these measures provide useful information to investors and the additional purposes for which management uses the non-GAAP financial information.SOURCE: Generac Holdings Inc.

(\u201cGenerac\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NYSE: GNRC) today announced the signing of an agreement to acquire Enbala Power Networks Inc. (\u201cEnbala\u201d), a leading distributed energy resources technology company. The deal solidifies Generac\u2019s position as a market leader in Smart Grid 2.0 technologies and opens opportunities for the Company as a grid services provider.  Denver-based Enbala is one of the leading providers of distributed energy optimization and control software needed to ensure the operational stability of the world\u2019s power grids. Its Enbala Concerto\u2122 platform is being used by utilities and energy retailers around the world to leverage the power of distributed energy resources (DERs) to respond to the real-time energy balancing needs of power systems and energy markets.\u201cWe\u2019re on the leading edge of a remarkable transformation of the electrical grid, moving from a dated and centralized power distribution model to one that will be digitized, decentralized and more resilient,\u201d said Aaron Jagdfeld, Chief Executive Officer of Generac. \u201cEnbala is a proven virtual power plant and distributed energy resource management platform, and we believe their business model can be incredibly synergistic with our business. We\u2019re proud to be at the forefront of the Smart Grid 2.0 with these new capabilities.\u201dWith thousands of megawatts of residential and industrial standby power generation installed in the United States, Generac\u2019s products can be leveraged in virtual power plant (VPP) and distributed energy resource management system (DERMS) markets. The Enbala Concerto\u2122 software platform enables the connection of DERs to register and participate in distributed energy aggregation and control programs. This means otherwise dormant back up power generation assets can come online as part of a distributed energy solution and generate revenue for the asset owner.As utility companies adopt cleaner forms of energy while simultaneously dealing with power disruptions, the opportunities to optimize the grid with DERs are becoming more creative. Residential and C&I rooftop solar, behind-the-meter battery storage systems, electric vehicles and flexible electricity load management are key asset components of a healthy future for Generac and distributed energy resources management.\u201cDistributed generation is a critical next step for utility companies faced with meeting peak demand while also dealing with capacity constraints and regulatory restrictions,\u201d said Jagdfeld. \u201cEnbala and Generac will be able to harness the power of everything from solar-plus-storage systems to our own generators to help limit the need for new power plants and maintain the convenience and flexibility of diversified power production.\u201d\u201cTogether with Generac, we have an unprecedented opportunity to make our energy grids more efficient, resilient and economical,\u201d said Bud Vos, President and CEO of Enbala. \u201cAs part of the Generac team, we can now accelerate our vision for a cleaner grid, leveraging our technology and capabilities that help continuously balance supply and demand while enabling rapid and profoundly beneficial changes in our energy markets.\u201dThe transaction is expected to close within thirty days.

And you guessed it, those months were February and March.Along these lines, its monthly low in March just happens to coincide near perfectly with its October 2019 low ($75.10).Typical Trading Pattern: Over the years as hurricanes have become more prevalent, \"hurricane issues\" often follow a similar trader pattern. Although market conditions can be a factor, they usually rally as forecasts for the storms are projected, sometimes much worse than expected. Once landfall is actually made, these issues often will make a blowoff top.Here We Go Again: As reports of Hurricane Laura began to make it into the mainstream media on a more frequent basis, Generac moved higher. In fact, Generac had moved from its Aug. 19 close ($181.20) to close Wednesday's session at $190.82.To The Moon, Alice: As so often happens, someone gets real overzealous in pre-market trading and it takes an issue to an unsustainable level typically on low volume; In the case of Generac, trading to $195 on low volume just after 7 a.m. ET. That far exceeded its all-time high that was made on Monday at $192.53.Sell The News: Co-host Dennis Dick, who is all too familiar with this pattern, took advantage of prior price behavior to capitalize on both the long and short side. When the issue was discussed on the show, it was trading at $194.\"Typically when the storm actually makes landfall, the stocks top,\" he said. \"If you are coming in now and buying these stocks, you are late to the party.\"Price Action In the Regular Session: After slightly lower open, it rallied but couldn't even reach Wednesday's high ($192.28), only reaching $191.29 and sharply reversed course. It has continued to make new lows for the session with the current one standing at $184.75 as of 1:30 p.m. ET.See more from Benzinga  * PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: Slack  * PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: Children's Place  * PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: ADMA Biologics(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

(NYSE: GNRC) (\u201cGenerac\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a leading global designer and manufacturer of energy technology solutions and other power products, today reported financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2020 and provided an update on its outlook for the full year 2020.  Second Quarter 2020 Highlights  * Net sales increased to $546.8 million during the second quarter of 2020 as compared to $541.9 million in the prior-year second quarter. Core sales growth, which excludes both the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency, increased approximately 1%.  \u2014\u00a0Residential product sales increased 27.2% to $341.4 million as compared to $268.4 million last year.  \u2014\u00a0Commercial & Industrial (\u201cC&I\u201d) product sales decreased 32.8% to $154.9 million as compared to $230.4 million in the prior year.  * Net income attributable to the Company during the second quarter was $66.1 million, or $1.02 per share, as compared to $62.0 million, or $0.98 per share, for the same period of 2019. The current year net income includes $11.5 million of pre-tax charges relating to restructuring costs and asset write-downs to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and decline in oil prices.  * Adjusted net income attributable to the Company, as defined in the accompanying reconciliation schedules, was $88.5 million, or $1.40 per share, as compared to $74.9 million, or $1.20 per share, in the second quarter of 2019.  * Adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interests, as defined in the accompanying reconciliation schedules, was $123.1 million, or 22.5% of net sales, as compared to $111.9 million, or 20.6% of net sales, in the prior year.  * Cash flow from operations was $101.8 million as compared to $8.0 million in the prior year. Free cash flow, as defined in the accompanying reconciliation schedules, was $89.0 million as compared to $(9.8) million for 2019. The increase was primarily due to a significant working capital investment that was made in the prior year which did not repeat in the current year. Modestly higher net income and lower capital expenditures also added to the increase in cash flow versus the prior year.  * As of June 30, 2020, the Company had $689 million of liquidity comprised of $397 million of cash and equivalents and $292 million available under its ABL revolving credit facility, which matures in June 2023. Also, the Company has no financial covenants and no maturities on its term loan until December 2026.  * The Company is increasing its full-year 2020 sales growth guidance to now be approximately 5 to 8% of positive year-over-year growth, which is an increase from the 5 to 10% decline previously expected. Adjusted EBITDA margins, before deducting for non-controlling interests, are now expected to be approximately 21.5 to 22.0%, which is an increase from the 19.0 to 20.0% previously expected.\u201cSecond quarter revenue and earnings dramatically exceeded our expectations primarily driven by robust demand for home standby generators as a result of the heightened awareness of the need for backup power since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. With power outages on the rise, concerns of utility shutoffs in California, an active hurricane forecast for the upcoming season, and Americans spending more time at home, demand for home standby generators is at an all-time high,\u201d said Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer. \u201cHowever, as expected, the ongoing pandemic around the world has significantly impacted demand for C&I products. As a result, during the second quarter we initiated a number of meaningful restructuring actions in this part of our business to better align our current cost structure with customer demand.\u201dJagdfeld continued, \u201cWhile there remains a high degree of uncertainty around the magnitude and timing of an economic recovery, demand for our residential products is clearly benefitting from the emerging \u201cHome as a Sanctuary\u201d trend as the importance of having an uninterrupted supply of power has never been more evident. This trend, along with elevated concerns about future outages, is underpinning the significant increase we are now expecting in our full-year revenue and earnings outlook for 2020. I\u2019m extremely proud of our team\u2019s efforts in ramping up operations to respond to this tremendous increase in demand, while at the same time providing the products, services, and support that are both essential and critical to our customers around the globe.\u201dAdditional Second Quarter 2020 Consolidated HighlightsThe current year net income includes $11.5 million of pre-tax charges relating to business optimization and other restructuring costs to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and decline in oil prices. The cost actions taken include certain headcount reductions, non-cash asset write-downs, and other charges. The charges, which primarily relate to C&I products, consist of $6.3 million classified within costs of goods sold and $5.2 million classified within operating expenses.Gross profit margin improved 210 basis points to 38.2% compared to 36.1% in the prior-year second quarter, which includes the impact of the aforementioned $6.3 million of charges classified within cost of goods sold. Excluding the impact of these charges, gross profit margin was 39.4%, an improvement of 330 basis points over the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by favorable sales mix from significantly higher shipments of home standby generators, along with lower mix of C&I products.Operating expenses increased $14.5 million, or 13.8%, as compared to the second quarter of 2019, which includes the impact of the aforementioned $5.2 million of charges classified within operating expenses. Excluding the impact of these charges, operating expenses for the quarter increased $9.3 million, or 8.9%, as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher employee costs and marketing spend, including incremental spend related to Clean Energy products, partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses for the international segment.Provision for income taxes for the current year quarter was $18.5 million, or an effective tax rate of 22.5%, as compared to $18.8 million, or a 23.4% effective tax rate, for the prior year. The lower effective tax rate in the current year is driven by higher share-based compensation deductions and a favorable geographical mix of earnings.Business Segment ResultsDomestic SegmentDomestic segment sales increased 9.3% to $460.8 million as compared to $421.5 million in the prior year quarter. The current year quarter experienced strong growth in shipments of home standby and portable generators as elevated outage activity and nationwide stay-at-home orders heightened consumer awareness of power reliability concerns. Chore products sold directly to consumers were also strong during the quarter as homeowners increased outdoor project activity while spending more time at home. In addition, shipments of the recently launched PWRcell energy storage system had a modest impact on growth despite the solar market being negatively impacted by deferrals of installations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This residential products growth was partially offset by continued weakness in sales of C&I mobile products following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and collapse in oil prices, as well as lower shipments of C&I products to national telecom customers as compared to a strong prior-year comparison.Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $121.3 million, or 26.3% of net sales, as compared to $103.7 million in the prior year, or 24.6% of net sales. This margin increase was driven by the favorable sales mix, partially offset by the aforementioned higher operating expense investments.International SegmentInternational segment sales, which consists primarily of C&I products, decreased 28.5% to $86.1 million as compared to $120.4 million in the prior year quarter. Core sales, which excludes the unfavorable impact of currency, declined approximately 25% compared to the prior year. The decline was driven by a continued broad-based sharp drop in global demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which magnified the underlying slower economic growth and geopolitical headwinds that were already being experienced.Adjusted EBITDA for the segment, before deducting for noncontrolling interests, was $1.9 million, or 2.2% of net sales, as compared to $8.2 million, or 6.8% of net sales, in the prior year. Decreased operating leverage on the lower sales volumes was the primary contributor to the margin decline, despite a proactive reduction in operating expenses.Updated 2020 OutlookWhile the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global C&I products is particularly severe, demand for residential products is benefitting from the emerging \u201cHome as a Sanctuary\u201d trend as more people are working, learning and in general, spending more time at home. With an aging and under-invested electrical grid and power outage severity on the rise, backup power for residential applications has now become more important than ever. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s residential products have historically proven to be more resilient and tend to decouple from the broader economic environment as demand is more driven by power outages.These incrementally positive fundamentals for residential products resulted in the significant revenue outperformance during the second quarter and are driving a much higher outlook for the second half of the year. Accordingly, the Company is raising its prior guidance for revenue growth for full-year 2020, and now expects an increase of approximately 5 to 8% compared to the prior year, which compares to the 5 to 10% decline previously expected. This guidance assumes a level of power outages in line with the longer-term baseline average, the benefit of one significant power shut-off event in California, and a recovery of the solar market in the second half of the year. In addition, should the outage environment in the second half of 2020 be higher due to an active hurricane season and widespread utility shut-offs in California, approximately 2 to 3% of additional revenue growth is possible over and beyond this baseline guidance.\u00a0As a result of the higher revenue expectations, net income margin, before deducting for non-controlling interests, is now expected to be approximately 12.0 to 12.5% for the full-year 2020, which is an increase from the prior expectation of between 9.5% to 10.5%. The corresponding adjusted EBITDA margin is now expected to be approximately 21.5 to 22.0%, which is an increase from the 19.0% to 20.0% previously expected.\u00a0Conference Call and WebcastGenerac management will hold a conference call at 9:00 a.m. EDT on Thursday, July 30, 2020 to discuss second quarter 2020 operating results.

Forward-looking statements give Generac's current expectations and projections relating to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"forecast,\" \"project,\" \"plan,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" \"confident,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"can have,\" \"likely,\" \"future,\" \u201coptimistic\u201d and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events.Any such forward looking statements are not guarantees of performance or results, and involve risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Company's control) and assumptions. Although Generac believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect Generac's actual financial results and cause them to differ materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements, including:  * frequency and duration of power outages impacting demand for our products;  * availability, cost and quality of raw materials and key components from our global supply chain and labor needed in producing our products;  * the impact on our results of possible fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodities, product mix and regulatory tariffs;  * the possibility that the expected synergies, efficiencies and cost savings of our acquisitions will not be realized, or will not be realized within the expected time period;  * the risk that our acquisitions will not be integrated successfully;  * difficulties we may encounter as our business expands globally or into new markets;  * our dependence on our distribution network;  * our ability to invest in, develop or adapt to changing technologies and manufacturing techniques;  * loss of our key management and employees;  * increase in product and other liability claims or recalls;  * failures or security breaches of our networks or information technology systems;  * changes in environmental, health and safety, or product compliance laws and regulations affecting our products or operations; and  * the duration and scope of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are uncertain and may or will continue to adversely affect our operations, supply chain, distribution, and demand for certain of our products and services.Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, Generac's actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in any forward-looking statements. In the current environment, some of the above factors have materialized and may or will continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which may cause actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of these and other factors that may affect future results is contained in Generac's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), particularly in the Risk Factors section of the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in its periodic reports on Form 10-Q. Stockholders, potential investors and other readers should consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements.Any forward-looking statement made by Generac in this press release speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Generac undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.Non-GAAP Financial MetricsCore SalesThe Company references core sales to further supplement Generac's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Core sales excludes the impact of acquisitions and fluctuations in foreign currency translation. Management believes that core sales facilitates easier and more meaningful comparison of net sales performance with prior and future periods.Adjusted EBITDAThe computation of adjusted EBITDA attributable to the Company is based on the definition of EBITDA contained in Generac's credit agreement dated as of May 31, 2013, as amended. To supplement the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Generac provides a summary to show the computation of adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the impact of noncontrolling interests, taking into account certain charges and gains that were recognized during the periods presented.\u00a0Adjusted Net IncomeTo further supplement Generac's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company provides a summary to show the computation of adjusted net income attributable to the Company. Adjusted net income attributable to the Company is defined as net income before noncontrolling interests and provision for income taxes adjusted for the following items: cash income tax expense, amortization of intangible assets, amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount related to the Company's debt, intangible impairment charges, certain transaction costs and other purchase accounting adjustments, losses on extinguishment of debt, business optimization expenses, certain other non-cash gains and losses, and adjusted net income attributable to non-controlling interests.Free Cash FlowIn addition, we reference free cash flow to further supplement Generac's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, plus proceeds from beneficial interests in securitization transactions, less expenditures for property and equipment, and is intended to be a measure of operational cash flow taking into account additional capital expenditure investment into the business.The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Please see the accompanying Reconciliation Schedules and our SEC filings for additional discussion of the basis for Generac's reporting of Non-GAAP financial measures, which includes why the Company believes these measures provide useful information to investors and the additional purposes for which management uses the non-GAAP financial information.SOURCE: Generac Holdings Inc.CONTACT:   Michael W.

have been included in the International reportable segment. Previously, GPS LATAM was reported in the Domestic segment, in amounts that were not material. To reflect this change, management has chosen to correct the net sales and adjusted EBITDA by segment as follows: For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, net sales of $4,406 and $7,156, and adjusted EBITDA of $845 and $592, respectively, were moved from the Domestic segment to the International segment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  (2) See reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net income attributable to Generac Holdings Inc. on the following reconciliation schedule.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0      Generac Holdings Inc.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Reconciliation Schedules\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  (U.S. Dollars in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  (Unaudited)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Net income to Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0Three Months Ended June 30,\u00a0Six Months Ended June 30,  \u00a0\u00a02020\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02019\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02020\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02019\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Net income attributable to Generac Holdings Inc.$66,145\u00a0\u00a0$61,958\u00a0\u00a0$110,605\u00a0\u00a0$106,819\u00a0  Net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests\u00a0(2,553)\u00a0\u00a0(252)\u00a0\u00a0(3,602)\u00a0\u00a0656\u00a0  Net income\u00a063,592\u00a0\u00a0\u00a061,706\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0107,003\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0107,475\u00a0  Interest expense\u00a07,932\u00a0\u00a0\u00a010,452\u00a0\u00a0\u00a016,985\u00a0\u00a0\u00a020,724\u00a0  Depreciation and amortization\u00a016,803\u00a0\u00a0\u00a014,740\u00a0\u00a0\u00a032,919\u00a0\u00a0\u00a027,347\u00a0  Provision for income taxes\u00a018,473\u00a0\u00a0\u00a018,827\u00a0\u00a0\u00a027,917\u00a0\u00a0\u00a033,812\u00a0  Non-cash write-down and other adjustments (1)\u00a0(893)\u00a0\u00a01,726\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01,391\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0326\u00a0  Non-cash share-based compensation expense (2)\u00a05,400\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04,334\u00a0\u00a0\u00a09,974\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07,928\u00a0  Transaction costs and credit facility fees (3)\u00a0358\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0413\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0592\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01,699\u00a0  Business optimization and other charges (4)\u00a011,460\u00a0\u00a0\u00a073\u00a0\u00a0\u00a011,972\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0242\u00a0  Other\u00a015\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(385)\u00a0\u00a0411\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(539)  Adjusted EBITDA\u00a0123,140\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0111,886\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0209,164\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0199,014\u00a0  Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests\u00a0132\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0763\u00a0\u00a0\u00a030\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02,813\u00a0  Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Generac Holdings Inc.$123,008\u00a0\u00a0$111,123\u00a0\u00a0$209,134\u00a0\u00a0$196,201\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  (1) Includes gains/losses on disposals of assets, unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on commodity contracts, and certain foreign currency related adjustments.
