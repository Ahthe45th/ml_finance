When the company realized the mistake and attempted to take the money back, it was gone and Spadoni wasn\u2019t answering her phone, the bank said.After a month of failed attempts to recover the cash, Schwab filed a criminal complaint on April 6, Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s Captain Jason Rivarde said. Spadoni, 33, was arrested the next day in Harvey, Louisiana, on charges of bank fraud, theft and illegal transmission of monetary funds, he said. She\u2019d transferred about $350,000 into another account and used it to buy a 2021 Hyundai Genesis sport-utility vehicle and a home, Rivarde said.\u201cThe vast majority of the missing money has been recovered at this point by the seizure of the vehicle and the reversal of the house sale,\u201d Rivarde said.Spadoni was fired from her job as a 911 dispatcher in the parish, Rivarde said. She was released April 8 on a bail bond, court records show.Schwab didn\u2019t respond to an email and phone call. A message left for Spadoni at a number listed for her wasn\u2019t returned.Schwab\u2019s mistake is among the technical blunders -- such as misplaced decimal points and \u201cfat finger\u201d errors -- that financial firms dread. But it\u2019s a trifle compared to the goof by Citigroup last summer. The bank meant to make an interest payment to Revlon Inc. lenders and instead wired them the principal, too, totaling $900 million. A judge later ruled many of the lenders could keep the money, though that decision is on appeal.But Citigroup\u2019s misadventure pales in comparison the error made in 2018 by Deutsche Bank AG, which inadvertently transferred 28 billion euros ($33.4 billion) to one of its outside accounts.The Schwab story was originally reported by nola.com and WVUE-TV.The case is Charles Schwab v. Spadoni, 21-cv-635, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans).(Updates with comment from law enforcement in third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=2211898a1d8d51f6ac25f42b72aace37700289566b6fe0d4936537dbb5a63975"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1618334460, "headline": "Charles Schwab Corp. stock outperforms competitors despite losses on the day", "id": 66137407, "image": "https://images.mktw.net/im-220105/social", "related": "SCHW", "source": "MarketWatch", "summary": "Shares of Charles Schwab Corp. slid 1.64% to $66.60 Tuesday, on what proved to be an all-around mixed trading session for the stock market, with the S&P 500...", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3931e889f982903288f8996ac1ed182a9f36569219c4f5b6c1fe63b2c04e4d36"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1618330204, "headline": "Why The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW) Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again", "id": 66524479, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/apbC75v0joJeGGZArvqIvw--~B/aD02NzU7dz05MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/zacks.com/105b2acef7bf0873f24b78932b1fdc3c", "related": "SCHW", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW) has an impressive earnings surprise history and currently possesses the right combination of the two key ingredients for a likely beat in its next quarterly report.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e8aa85d25004fb5c7f2b839130dfe36124111fc5a3879bdbc6ea39f45e8e05ba"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1618308900, "headline": "Charles Schwab put volume heavy and directionally bearish", "id": 66286342, "image": "", "related": "SCHW", "source": "Thefly.com", "summary": "Charles Schwab put volume heavy and directionally bearish SCHW", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=85a04037309d7491e7edb7b7f552e02999c62b6df54837732d48765d72bf1e39"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1618285560, "headline": "Parnassus Endeavor Fund`s Top 1st-Quarter Trades", "id": 66286344, "image": "https://static.gurufocus.com/photos/gurus/guru_logo_square.jpg", "related": "SCHW", "source": "GuruFocus", "summary": "Parnassus Endeavor Fund's Top 1st-Quarter Trades, Stocks: MU,AMAT,VZ,SPGI,OMC,SCHW,INTC,CSCO, Parnassus Endeavor Fund, Jerome Dodson, release date:Apr 13, 2021", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=0979e3ffc60a26370683d947f55296a862ef645d64af6980561178b2dab19daf"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1618248000, "headline": "Charles Schwab Corp. stock outperforms competitors on strong trading day", "id": 66137408, "image": "https://images.mktw.net/im-220105/social", "related": "SCHW", "source": "MarketWatch", "summary": "Shares of Charles Schwab Corp. inched 0.21% higher to $67.71 Monday, on what proved to be an all-around rough trading session for the stock market, with the...", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=f0812d7ef3fb7886ee5429ec0cf2e9378517e298e981957cdbed7b7634d510e6"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1618240764, "headline": "Big Week For Financial Sector Earnings Reports: Here's A Quick Preview Of A Few Names", "id": 66128132, "image": "https://media.gettyimages.com/vectors/businessman-planting-small-sapling-on-watering-bar-chart-business-vector-id1225327578?b=1&k=6&m=1225327578&s=170667a&w=0&h=6GEAZZOL3U00lPVGsUBiM84WkmD6F9Im0-ljyqgsjLI=", "related": "SCHW", "source": "SeekingAlpha", "summary": "As we exited the first quarter 2021, JPMorgan and Schwab remain the two largest financial positions, with the Chicago Merc being the 3rd largest position and then Berkshire Hathaway.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c7c198d768f1cf9a5264062c57e85f2dfdecda2764e365da931ab5550434cf1a"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1618230540, "headline": "A Jam-Packed Week Ahead", "id": 66128648, "image": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/og_image_social_share_1200x630/images/story/2012/sigmund-r401qwthw7w-unsplash_1.jpg", "related": "SCHW", "source": "Benzinga", "summary": "JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u00a0(NYSE: JPM), Goldman Sachs Group Inc\u00a0(NYSE: GS), Delta Air Lines, Inc.
