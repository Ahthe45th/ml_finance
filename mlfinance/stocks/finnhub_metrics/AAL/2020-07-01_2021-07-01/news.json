(DAL) gained 1.8% to close at $45.77 on June 21, spiked by a Reuters news report on the airlines' plan to hire over 1,000 pilots by next summer. \n\n\n\nThe additional hiring is driven by the management\u2019s belief that U.S. leisure travel volumes will return to the pre-pandemic levels. The airline is also seeing a surge in business travel.\n\n\n\nNotably, Delta expects to post a pre-tax profit in the second half of 2021, after posting huge losses in FY20 due to the COVID-19 situation. The profit will be aided by the expected restart of corporate America by Labor Day (September 6).\n\n\n\nDelta\u2019s Chief of Operations John Laughter said, \u201cThe fact that we expect to record a profit in June - just 15 months after the sharpest decline in aviation history - is remarkable\". Laughter anticipates that travel restrictions will alleviate across the Atlantic in the second half of 2021, with re-openings expected in Spain, France, Italy, and Greece.\n\n\n\nImportantly, June 20 marked the highest number of U.S. travelers, 2.1 million, since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020. However, this number is still 23% lower than pre-pandemic levels.\n\n\n\nConsequentially, other airlines are also gearing up to increase the number of pilots and overall employees to meet the increasing demand.\n\n\n\nLikewise, American Airlines\u00a0(AAL)\u00a0announced its plans to resume pilot hiring in the fall, with approximately 300 new pilots joining by the end of the year and double that number in 2022.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Southwest Airlines\u00a0(LUV) expects to hire First Officers later this year \"to support the airline\u2019s 2022 operations and scheduled aircraft deliveries.\" However, 500 pilots are still under its voluntary leave program.\n\n\n\nIn addition, United Airlines Holdings (UAL)\u00a0intends to add 300 new pilots in the coming weeks. Beyond that, incremental hiring will depend on the recovery trends. Longer-term, United plans to hire around 10,000 pilots by 2030.\n\n\n\nWolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay recently upgraded Delta to Buy from Sell with a price target of $55 (20.2% upside potential).\n\n\n\nKeay\u2019s upgrade is based on \"pent-up demand scenario later this summer, unlike what's happening with leisure now.\" However, he remains doubtful that business travel will return to pre-pandemic levels in the long run. \n\n\n\nOverall, Delta Airlines has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 8 Buys and 3 Holds. The average Delta Airlines analyst\u00a0price target of $58.75\u00a0implies 28.4% upside potential from current levels. Shares of DAL have jumped 56% over the past year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated News:Danaher Snaps up Aldevron for $9.6B; Shares Spike 5%Kroger Raises Full-Year Guidance on Strong Q1 Results; Shares Jump 4%XPO Logistics\u2019 GXO Prices Notes Offering Worth $800M", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=08ca9e3f327140768b9c53f1108eb82eb5aaaebf601ca98549c92237a30c938a"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1624336740, "headline": "BROKER RATINGS: JPMorgan raises British Land and Landsec; boohoo cut", "id": 68416651, "image": "", "related": "AAL", "source": "Alliance News", "summary": "Looking for stock market analysis and research with proves results?

(See American Airlines stock chart on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nThe aggressive COVID-19 vaccination programs across the U.S. have resulted in a significant reduction in travel restrictions. The lifting of restrictions provides the much-needed incentive for people to move around.

American Airlines (AAL) was expected to receive a new Dreamliner this week. However, the delivery cannot be fulfilled by Boeing until next week at the earliest. The delay follows a recent 5-month suspension in deliveries of aircraft due to production issues. Last year, a review of Boeing\u2019s Dreamliner production was initiated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which has increased scrutiny of the company\u2019s 737 MAX manufacturing operations following earlier factory slip-ups. The FAA recently requested more information about the company\u2019s proposed solution for addressing previously identified quality lapses. (See Boeing stock analysis on TipRanks) Boeing told the WSJ that it is working in a speedily and transparent manner to give out the details. The company is required to prove that its inspection method, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive, adheres to the federal safety regulations. Last month, Boeing CEO David Calhoun revealed plans to deliver 10-12 Dreamliners every month. With the recent development, the company will most likely miss that target. The delivery halt could bring further pressure on the company\u2019s finances since customers usually pay most of the aircraft\u2019s price on receipt of the aircraft. On May 25, Morgan Stanley analyst Kristine Liwag maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $274 (10.9% upside potential) on the stock. Liwag believes that 737 aircraft are flying at an increasing number of airlines both in the U.S. and internationally. He added, \u201cAirlines have shown some improvement in the number of flights following the grounding of 737 MAX planes in April. WoW, AAL had an increase of 29% while UAL had an increase of 46%.\u201d Overall, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 7 Buys and 7 Holds. The average analyst price target of $270 implies 9.3% upside potential from current levels. Shares of Boeing have jumped 63.2% over the past year.

Americans are once again commuting to the office, planning major travel for the first time and booking flights. A prolonged disruption along the pipeline system threatens to send average U.S. gasoline prices above $3 a gallon for the first time since October 2014, further stoking fears of inflation as commodity prices rally worldwide.With little to no clarity over when the system will return, traders are seeking vessels to deliver gasoline that would have otherwise been shipped on the Colonial system, according to market participants who asked not to be identified because the information isn\u2019t public. Some tankers are being secured to temporarily store gasoline in the U.S. Gulf in the event of a prolonged shutdown, they said.Colonial halted all operations on its system late Friday after suffering a ransomware attack that affected some of its IT systems.Colonial is just the latest example of critical infrastructure being targeted by ransomware. Hackers are increasingly attempting to infiltrate essential services such as electric grids and hospitals. The escalating threats prompted the White House to respond last month with a plan to increase security at utilities and their suppliers. Pipelines are a specific concern because of the central role they play in the U.S. economy.\u201cIt\u2019s an all-hands-on-deck effort right now,\u201d U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said of federal government actions as the shutdown drags on. \u201cWe are working closely with the company, state and local officials to make sure that they get back up to normal operations as quickly as possible and there aren\u2019t disruptions in supply.\u201dColonial is a major source of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel to the East Coast from the nation\u2019s refining belt along the U.S. Gulf Coast. It has the capacity to send about 2.5 million barrels a day on its system from Houston as far as North Carolina, and another 900,000 barrels a day to New York.The attack appeared to use a ransomware group called DarkSide, according to Allan Liska, senior threat analyst at cybersecurity firm Recorded Future. The cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc. said its Mandiant incident response division was assisting with the investigation.Extortion FeeRansomware cases involve hackers seeding networks with malicious software that encrypts the data and leaves the machines locked until the victims pay the extortion fee. This would be the biggest attack of its kind on a U.S. fuel pipeline.The national gasoline average stood at $2.96 a gallon Friday, according to auto club AAA. With gasoline inventories ample, the pump price wasn\u2019t expected to tick much higher until Memorial Day at the end of May, which is traditionally viewed as the start of the U.S. summer driving season. If the pipeline doesn\u2019t restart soon it will accelerate the move higher.\u201cI think we\u2019re at strong odds for it by Memorial Day given current trends,\u201d said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at Gas Buddy.A key concern at present is meeting product demand in the U.S. Southeast, which is especially dependent on the Colonial system, people familiar with the situation said. Drivers in landlocked and car-dependent Atlanta may be the first to feel the pinch at the pump.\u201cAtlanta will be one of the earlier sore spots, along with eastern Tennessee, and perhaps the Carolinas,\u201d De Haan said.The Northeast can secure gasoline shipments from Europe but it will come at an increasing cost the longer the pipeline stays shut.\u201cThe longer it lasts, the more bullish it will be for refined products on the East Coast,\u201d said Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING Groep NV. \u201cThis will likely also drag European product prices higher, as we see more waterborne cargoes needing to go into the U.S. East Coast to meet the shortfall.\u201dAirports on the East Coast, which continue to have some of the steepest drops in air traffic due to the pandemic, have been operating smoothly Sunday, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware.com.In the meantime, fuel producers including Marathon Petroleum Corp. are weighing alternatives for how to ship their products to the Northeast.One potential route is the Kinder Morgan-operated Plantation Pipeline, even though it only extends as far north Washington D.C. and has a capacity of 720,000 barrels a day, far short of Colonial\u2019s. Kinder said Sunday it\u2019s working with customers to accommodate additional barrels during Colonial\u2019s outage, and that Plantation is deferring where possible any non-essential maintenance that might otherwise reduce flow rates.While all of the major segments of Colonial\u2019s system remain offline, some smaller so-called laterals connecting specific fuel terminals to delivery points are in service, the company said. That laterals gave some traders hope that the full network may be back online within a week.\u201cHopefully it is a sign that they have made progress either negotiating with those responsible for the attack or have found ways to operate around it, said Debnil Chowdhury, head of Americas refining at IHS Markit. \u201cHowever to avoid product shortages, all efforts should be made to avoid a 5+ day outage of the main lines.\u201dInventories offer minimal cover, ClearView Energy Partners said in a research note. Tankers leaving Rotterdam could take up to 14 days to make the trip to the New York Harbor. The Midwest could theoretically send some of its supplies to the East Coast via rail and barge, but the region\u2019s inventories are tighter than in previous years, ClearView said.\u201cThe Colonial outage comes at a critical juncture for the recovering U.S. economy: the start of the summer driving season,\u201d ClearView said. \u201cWe therefore think lawmakers could begin a \u2018blame game\u2019 immediately, and a sustained disruption that leads to a significant pump price spike could increase prospects of domestic policy interventions.\u201dFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=561bff800cbaaf1a50aa6f5d17b7d8e67fff03c3ebdabae5ead8f163e2e0b155"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620708120, "headline": "IN BRIEF: Evraz picks 3 new board members, including Centamin chair", "id": 67734860, "image": "", "related": "AAL", "source": "Alliance News", "summary": "Looking for stock market analysis and research with proves results?

Finding specific stocks to play bullish or bearish has felt similar to finding a needle in a haystack, especially with tech pulling back from all-time highs over earnings season. The airline sector has yet to take the stage despite a ramp-up in the vaccine rollout and customers returning to the skies for business and travel. Rotation could be set to change this, however. Boeing Co (NYSE: BA), American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ: AAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) look like they could be set for take-off. The Boeing Chart: On Friday, Boeing broke up from a descending trendline that had been holding it down since April 5. Although Boeing has briefly traded above the trendline, Friday marked the first day the stock has been able to close the day above it. This will give bulls more confidence. On Friday, Boeing also recaptured the eight-day exponential moving average (EMA) and the stock is trading above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), which are both bullish indicators. Boeing still needs to recapture the 21-day EMA, which it could do this week if bullish volume is sustained. Bulls want to see Boeing\u2019s stock make a move up to its next resistance level at $243.75. Bullish volume could then pop the stock over that level which would then make it support. If Boeing can gain the $243 area as support, it has room to move back up toward the $257.75 mark. Bears want to see Boeing's stock fall back under the descending trendline, which will cause the stock to lose support at $232.70. A loss of that level could see Boeing revisit $223.71 before finding additional support. The American Airlines Chart: On Friday, big bullish volume entered American Airlines and the stock was able to make a 2.37% move north. This helped the stock recapture the eight-day and 21-day EMAs which is bullish. American Airlines is trading above the 200-day SMA which indicates overall sentiment in the stock is bullish. Bulls want to see follow-through bull volume push American Airlines up over its next resistance level at $22.58. If it can regain that level as support, it has room to move up to fill the overhead gap in the $26 area. Since gaps are filled 90% of the time, it is likely American Airlines will trade back in this range in the future. Bears want to see big bearish volume enter American Airlines\u2019 stock and for it to drop down and lose support at the $21 area. If the stock can\u2019t maintain the level as support, it could descend towards $18.94. The Southwest Chart: Unlike Boeing and American Airlines, which are trading down 47% and 62%, respectively, from all-time highs, Southwest is only 7% below its all-time high. Friday\u2019s action may indicate the stock is about to take another run back towards its Dec. 21, 2017, all-time high of $66.99. On Friday, Southwest broke up from a descending trendline that has been holding it down since April 6. The bullish break helped Southwest to regain the eight-day and 21-day EMAs, which is bullish. Like Boeing and American Airlines, Southwest is trading above the 200-day EMA which is bullish. Bulls want to see Southwest\u2019s stock hold over top of the descending trendline and for bullish volume to help it push up above its next resistance level near $63.50. If the stock can regain that level as support, it has room to make a run back towards all-time highs. Bears want to see bearish volume push Southwest\u2019s stock back under the descending trendline which would force it to lose a support level at $60.10. If Southwest trades below that level, it could retest $557.95 before potentially bouncing. See Also: Stock Wars: JetBlue Vs. Southwest Price Action: Boeing closed Friday\u2019s session at $235.47. Shares of American Airlines closed at $22, and Southwest\u2019s stock closed at $61.66.
