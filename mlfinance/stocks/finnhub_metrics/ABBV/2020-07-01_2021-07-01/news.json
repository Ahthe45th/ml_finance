(See AbbVie stock chart on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nThe company said the FDA did not take any formal action on the sNDAs for Rinvoq in ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. AbbVie specializes in gastroenterology, women's health, virology, eye care, neuroscience, oncology, and immunology treatments.\n\n\n\nThe MD, Vice-Chairman, and President of AbbVie, Michael Severino, said, \u201cWe remain committed to working with the FDA to bring Rinvoq to patients living with psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and other immune-mediated diseases.\u201d\n\n\n\nPiper Sandler analyst Christopher Raymond recently maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $124 (9.75% upside potential).\n\n\n\nIn a research note to investors, Raymond said the FDA\u2019s reason for not meeting the PDUFA target dates makes Rinvoq's label expansion uncertain. It also casts doubt on whether AbbVie will be able to achieve its revenue guidance of $8 billion for 2025.\n\n\n\nOverall, the stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 10 Buys and 2 Holds. The average AbbVie price target of $122.82 implies 8.7% upside potential from current levels.

AbbVie\u2019s Allergan Aesthetics unit will pay 0 million in cash to scoop up Soliton Inc (NASDAQ: SOLY) and Resonic, its sound-wave device that improves the appearance of cellulite. Under the terms of the transaction, Allergan Aesthetics will pay $22.60 per share in cash for each outstanding share of Soliton. The body sculpting offering will help add some heft to the Allergan Aesthetics brand, which includes cosmetic Botox as its most visible product. AbbVie propped up the aesthetics business as part of its $63 billion buyout of Allergan last year, keeping Botox\u2019s therapeutic indications under the AbbVie brand. Allergan Aesthetics already has a product in CoolSculpting Elite. Still, the Soliton pickup adds a non-invasive option in Resonic, which also holds approval in tattoo removal alongside lasers and improves the appearance of fibrotic scars. Cosmetic Botox cleared $447 million in the first quarter, a 44.7% Y/Y increase. The unit, on the whole, made $1.14 billion in sales on the quarter. Meanwhile, the overall AbbVie business cleared more than $13 billion in sales on the quarter, led once again by Humira at $3.9 billion. Price Action: SOLY shares are up 23.7% at $22.27, while ABBV shares are up 0.31% at $116.12 during the market trading session on the last check Monday.

To me, it sounds like the blind leading the blind. Every year, a new hotshot claims to have the inside path to profitable stocks to buy. And more often than not, the market eventually blindsides them. That\u2019s why folks should listen to those who\u2019ve been there before like Warren Buffett. For one thing, Warren Buffett has been investing in blue-chip stocks since the birth of Christ. He\u2019s lived through multiple economic and market cycles so nothing really surprises him. Yes, the individual stocks to buy may look different but in the end, it comes down to the free market principles of supply and demand. And one of the best teachers of profitability exploiting such dynamics is experience. Yet we should realize that Warren Buffett was once young too. Born on Aug. 30, 1930, Buffett graduated from high school when he was 17 years old. He never intended to go to college. However, his father insisted that he attend the Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania. But the younger Buffett only stayed two years, \u201ccomplaining that he knew more than his professors,\u201d according to The Balance contributor Joshua Kennon.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips This sounds to me like Warren Buffett was the original YouTube guru. But the difference is that unlike all the junk that you see on the blogosphere, he knew what he was talking about. Eventually, he would amass a financial empire that would allow him to take control of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B). If you read his bio, you\u2019ll find that Buffett wasn\u2019t just great at picking stocks to buy \u2014 he was a real OG. 7 Stocks to Buy Right Now With All Eyes on Crypto In my view, if you\u2019re going to learn from somebody, it should be a person like Buffett, a man who was born during the Great Depression, went through his youthful exuberance phase, formed a time-proven investment strategy and still continues to fight like the best of \u2018em at 90 freaking years old! Below are some key stocks to buy from the holdings of Berkshire Hathaway. AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) American Express (NYSE:AXP) Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) Chevron (NYSE:CVX) Itochu Corporation (OTCMKTS:ITOCF) Verisign (NASDAQ:VRSN) Now, I should note that despite my high praise for Warren Buffett, he\u2019s not the ultimate arbiter of equity valuations: the market is. Even though these stocks to buy are compelling because they\u2019re on the Berkshire list, nothing is infallible. Maintain money management discipline and a long-term prospective, though, and you should do well in the end. Stocks to Buy: AbbVie (ABBV) Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com Berkshire Hathaway has a number of healthcare-related companies on its list. But the one that caught my attention was AbbVie. Yes, I have some personal bias in that I\u2019ve discussed the bullish case for ABBV stock. But well beyond that, I like to think that Warren Buffett and I are on the same wavelength \u2014 well, at least as long AbbVie specifically is concerned. Yes, everybody knows AbbVie as one of the giant pharmaceutical stocks to buy. It\u2019s perhaps most popular for the drug Humira, which has been formulated to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease and psoriasis, among many other conditions. As well, AbbVie features an extensive list of oncology-related solutions. Should the novel coronavirus outbreak fade out completely, the treatment for long-term diseases should take precedence based on pent-up demand, if you will. But what may really drive ABBV stock is Botox, which came under the AbbVie umbrella when it acquired Allergan. During the Covid-19 lockdowns, there was little incentive to look good. Now that we\u2019re slowly but surely returning to our normal schedules, we have a \u201cright\u201d to be vainer. Cynically, this is good news for ABBV, making it one of the best Berkshire-held stocks to buy. Amazon (AMZN) Source: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com Admittedly, Berkshire doesn\u2019t have nearly as much allocation toward Amazon shares as it does many of its other holdings. At only a 0.1% stake, it\u2019s not Buffett\u2019s highest-conviction trade, that\u2019s for sure. Still, a 0.1% stake is a non-zero number, which means AMZN is one of the stocks to buy or at least to consider. I\u2019m going to get the bad stuff out of the way. Certainly, you can\u2019t deny that AMZN stock has a PR problem. Back during the early days of the Covid-19 crisis, many workers demanded basic dignities, such as paid time off for employees who were sick or displayed Covid-19 symptoms. Not helping matters is that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos consistently swapped places with elite tycoons as the richest person in the world. Yeah, we can talk all day about free market capitalism but come on \u2014 sometimes enough is enough. Still, despite the troubles, Amazon\u2019s relevance can\u2019t be denied. When the brick and mortars had to shut down based on government mandates, e-commerce filled the gap. And Amazon dominates e-commerce. 7 Hot Stocks to Consider for a Greener Future While the percentage of e-commerce sales relative to total retail sales has come down since the peak of the crisis, it\u2019s still very much elevated from pre-pandemic norms. I don\u2019t see this reversing anytime soon, which is why Berkshire includes it on its list of stocks to buy. Stocks to Buy: American Express (AXP) Source: Shutterstock For me, American Express represents a perhaps delusional notion that in certain circumstances, Warren Buffett and I think alike. Generally speaking, I\u2019m somewhat hesitant on credit cards. Certainly, I can see their appeal in the present context. Throughout most of last year, the Covid-19 crisis deflated consumer sentiment, which naturally boosted the personal saving rate. Today, with much of the economy reopening, consumers are ready to spend. Further, you have the stimulus checks that former President Donald Trump and incumbent President Joe Biden signed off on. Thank you, gentlemen. But will such measures really boost spending holistically? Sure, I get the narrative that spending will rise because Americans want to catch up on their retail therapy. But credit cards are debt instruments and consumers historically haven\u2019t shown much restraint with debt instruments. But AXP stock may not suffer from such concerns as the underlying company caters to wealthier individuals. It seems that the folks at Berkshire Hathaway understand this point very clearly. AXP features an 18.9% stake. In contrast, Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) both have a 0.5% stake. So if you\u2019re going to get Buffett-inspired credit card stocks to buy, go for American Express. Charter Communications (CHTR) Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com A classic Warren Buffett move, the inclusion of Charter Communications by Berkshire Hathaway doesn\u2019t surprise me in the least. As a telecommunications and mass-media company under the Charter Spectrum brand name, CHTR was one of the most relevant stocks to buy. Providing high-speed cable and fiber-internet access, along with mobile services, Charter is integral to our modern infrastructure. But with the Covid-19 crisis, CHTR stock became even more ingrained. With millions of white-collar workers forced to operate out of their living rooms, reliable high-speed internet services commanded a premium. Not that it should bear any influence on whether you should acquire shares of Charter Communications but I personally made the switch to Spectrum and I couldn\u2019t be happier. While anecdotal, I\u2019ll tell you what makes CHTR compelling among the Buffett-inspired stocks to buy. Yes, Spectrum\u2019s coverage area spans 44 states. But it\u2019s also where they dominate that matters. For instance, Spectrum has the widest coverage in California, Texas and New York. When you combine the GDP of these three states, you\u2019re talking about $6.55 trillion of economic activity. 8 Blue-Chip Stocks With Strong Earnings Such a combined entity would make it the third-biggest country in the world, usurping Japan. Thus, CHTR is sticking around, which is why Berkshire owns it. Stocks to Buy: Chevron (CVX) Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com Chevron might be one of the surprising stocks to buy on the Berkshire Hathaway list, prompting criticism that perhaps Buffett might be losing it. As you know, American consumers have gravitated toward electric vehicles. And that\u2019s not just a \u201cfashion statement.\u201d Millennials care about sustainability and growing evidence suggests that Generation Z is taking cues, increasing the magnitude of holistic awareness. On the surface, CVX stock doesn\u2019t seem to make much sense. Yes, Chevron and the big oil machinery are relevant today. But tomorrow, the tide will likely turn. It\u2019s not just millennials that consistently influence current affairs. More significantly, government leadership is also pivoting toward a cleaner, more sustainable future. Obviously, the Biden administration wishes to push its environmental protection agenda. Up and coming politicians will probably carry the torch. Big oil stocks to buy are done for. Then again, maybe not. I think CVX may represent a case of Buffett\u2019s contrarianism. This is speculation on my part but it\u2019s possible that Buffett and the Berkshire team don\u2019t view the electrification of transportation as economically viable just yet. Even if it became so, Buffett probably recognizes that oil will be around for a very long time, in part due to the high energy density of fossil fuels. So yeah, CVX is a keeper. Itochu Corporation (ITOCF) Source: VladSV / Shutterstock.com I\u2019m familiar with most of the stocks to buy under the Berkshire umbrella. But the name that caught me by surprise was Itochu Corporation. Frankly, I understand both value and growth investors pivot to Asia. However, this almost always means Chinese companies. On the other hand, Japan hasn\u2019t been making much news aside from deflation-related headlines. So why Itochu? If somebody would ask that question to Warren Buffett, I\u2019d be most grateful as it would give us all a deeper insight into one of the world\u2019s greatest investors. But if I had to guess, it would be Itochu\u2019s exposure to world-class Japanese manufacturing. Itochu is one of Japan\u2019s biggest general trading companies and thus touches on many relevant sectors. But the underlying theme is manufacturing. Interestingly, Harvard Business Review did a story on Japan\u2019s manufacturing prowess. Initially, business experts attributed its outperformance to superior methodologies. But later, these same experts noted that Japan\u2019s production attributes were contradictory to commonly held beliefs: \u201c\u2026many Japanese factories practicing lean manufacturing appeared to surpass their U.S. counterparts on several dimensions; they achieved lower cost, higher quality, faster product introductions, and greater flexibility, all at the same time.\u201d 7 Consumer Stocks to Buy Before Picnic Season Begins In other words, there\u2019s something in the water when it comes to Japanese manufacturing. Buffett might be recognizing this, thus explaining the inclusion of ITOCF stock. Stocks to Buy: Verisign (VRSN) Source: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com Warren Buffett is old. But what I really appreciate about him is that he continues to defy stereotypes. Honestly, at 90 years old, he should be referred to in the past tense. But he\u2019s still out there, leading one of the biggest companies in the world. Good for him and it\u2019s a powerful lesson for all of us. What I especially like is that Buffett isn\u2019t just out there as a charity case. Instead, he\u2019s making bold calls regarding stocks to buy, one of them being Verisign. Well before anyone knew about the SARS-CoV-2 virus, VRSN was an incredibly relevant idea due to its internet network infrastructure operations, including managing the registry for .com and .net domains. That\u2019s serious influence right there. But Covid-19 has dramatically changed the paradigm of work. Though many employees are heading back to the office, several organizations \u2014 including high-level blue chips \u2014 remain open-minded about a full return to normal. And a ton of them are not in a hurry to have everyone clocking back in. There\u2019s also the narrative that many folks who got a taste of the gig worker\u2019s life want to maintain such freedom. To be fair, I\u2019m not sure if companies will allow employees to work 100% from home. Therefore, we could see an increase in independent contract work, which should bolster Verisign\u2019s business. Overall, VRSN stock is one to watch closely as we navigate the post-Covid world.

With an unprecedented crisis rippling throughout the international community, the global equity markets initially tumbled on the mass spread of the disease. If anyone wanted to go contrarian, they should have done so on the companies that now presented excellent value. Instead, risk-on money poured into growth names like a thunderstorm. Indeed, much of the enthusiasm was understandable. For instance, tech firms that specialized in contactless services \u2014 digital documentation and teleconferencing come to mind \u2014 performed extraordinarily well. At the same time, you\u2019d figure that value stocks should also get some love. No, they might not carry the sexiness that growth plays do. However, many, if not most, value stocks are tied to stable, relevant industries. Quite a few pay dividends, which add to their appeal. In other words, these are organizations that simply got caught in a downdraft through no fault of their own. Therefore, it\u2019s plausible that they can make a comeback down the line.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Another reason to consider value stocks is that their growth counterparts tend to peter out when their catalysts fade. I think that\u2019s the number one risk for equity units that received extreme bullishness. Usually, such bullish cycles also tend to correct substantially. So, investors should consider value stocks to diversify their exposure to these crazy markets. 10 of the Top Nasdaq Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy Of course, just because you go with value stocks over growth names doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they\u2019re guaranteed to move higher in the years ahead. This is the capital markets we\u2019re talking about and anything can change. On this list, I\u2019ve included a mix of companies with different risk-reward profiles, proving that value doesn\u2019t always have to be so square.

During the advent of this sector, many people considered it to be child\u2019s play. As a former nerd \u2014 well, maybe that hasn\u2019t changed \u2014 I can attest to many of the stereotypes of avid gamers. But the Covid-19 crisis also sparked a mini-renaissance in this sector. According to a Nielsen survey, 55% of Americans played video games to wile away the hours during the initial phase of lockdowns. An early 2021 TheVerge.com article argues that this habit is here to stay. That benefits Nintendo, one of the rare gaming-related value stocks. While other video game companies skyrocketed off the pandemic\u2019s unexpected catalyst, NTDOY stock still offers a great value proposition. Currently, its forward price-earnings ratio is 18.5, whereas the interactive media industry \u2014 of which Nintendo is a part \u2014 has a median forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 29. Also, NTDOY stock is down 11% for the year, which contrasts with other gaming rivals. It might not get the love because of its underlying family friendly orientation. But in my view, this is a positive, making NTDOY one of the best value stocks to consider. NRG Energy (NRG) Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com In late 2020, shares of NRG Energy looked poised to go gangbusters and they pretty much did. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard by now, NRG Energy is one of the biggest power generators and retailers in Texas. Unfortunately, a terrible winter storm devastated the Lone Star State and affected regions are still picking up the pieces. According to the Houston Chronicle, NRG stated that \u201cit lost an estimated $750 million from February\u2019s winter storm that knocked out generators and electricity across the state.\u201d To be fair, this is one of the trickier value stocks in that the underlying company isn\u2019t totally faultless. This was a disaster that culminated with many fail points being checked off one after the other. In hindsight, both public and private elements should have cooperated to bolster energy infrastructures in case stuff like this happened. I mean, there was recent precedent, with rolling blackouts in California. Still, this was mostly an Act of God and NRG stock got caught out. 7 Marijuana Stocks to Buy As Canada\u2019s Consumption Continues to Rise However, this does make the company one of the undervalued stocks in the energy space, with a forward P/E ratio of 13.5 times, whereas the industry median is 19.5 times. Value Stocks to Buy: AbbVie (ABBV) Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com When the coronavirus first became an unwanted guest in the U.S., it was a matter of time before the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread everywhere. Frankly, it was a shame because initially, the Former President Donald Trump\u2019s administration had the right response: keep people out, including infected Americans. As the Washington Post stated, the former president was not told Covid-19 sickened Americans would be flown home from a Diamond Princess cruise ship. In my opinion, this represented total failure of governance and respect for the chain of command. And with Trump not displaying the best performance under pressure, the American outbreak became an inevitability. Cynically, this benefitted biotechnology firms developing vaccines and treatments. But AbbVie? Not so much since the company didn\u2019t make as aggressive of a pivot to Covid-19 like its peers. However, now that coronavirus cases are fading in the U.S., ABBV stock has become one of the more intriguing value stocks to consider. In large part, I say this because of its Botox business. You see, when people are quarantining, there\u2019s not much emphasis on looking good. Once the pandemic fades, superficiality will be back on the bandwagon. Therefore, ABBV stock makes sense on the fundamentals shifting favorably toward its underlying business. Altria Group (MO) Source: defotoberg / Shutterstock.com As one of the undervalued stocks in the vice industry, Altria Group may not be for everyone\u2019s sensibilities. Also, MO stock is rather risky. Over the trailing five years, shares have lost 24% of market value. Much of that is due to declining smoking rates. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the percentage of those who quit increased from 50.8% in 2005 to 59% in 2016. The FDA is also planning a ban on flavored cigarettes and cigars. Still, the CDC points out that nearly 38 million Americans smoked cigarettes either everyday or some days in 2016. With the pandemic, this figure may have accelerated. Sure, you hear stories about people quitting because of the pandemic. But the crisis also incentivizes the dangerous habit due to increased stress. Another cynical factor that might aid MO stock is the war against vaping. On the surface, vaping seems like a less-offensive alternative to \u201canalog\u201d cigarettes. But the \u201cPreventing Online Sales of E-Cigarettes to Children (PACT) Act has forced many companies to discontinue U.S. online sales and even cease operations altogether,\u201d according to TobaccoReporter.com. 7 Stocks to Buy for May If this trend continues, it could spark a rise in traditional cigarette smoking, which makes Altria an interesting though controversial name to consider. Value Stocks to Buy: The Geo Group (GEO) Source: JosephRouse / Shutterstock.com On the surface, The Geo Group\u2019s specialty, adult rehabilitation, doesn\u2019t sound controversial at all. Until you realize that the company is really talking about private prisons. Naturally, GEO is one of the ugliest value stocks available. Nevertheless, the underlying business of GEO stock has a long series of pros and cons. Of course, there\u2019s something unsavory about investors benefitting off the misery of others. People are in prison to pay their debt to society. It\u2019s not necessarily an avenue from which to extract profit. So why have GEO stock at all? The answer is that government is rarely the best solution, whether we\u2019re talking about advancing capitalistic enterprises or for doling out punitive measures. Turns out, private prisons, because they\u2019re private, can do the job more effectively, potentially leading to lower recidivism. While that might sound like a benefit to taxpayers, you should know that various research papers provide conflicting analyses. Therefore, if you are a conscientious investor, you may want to dig a little deeper before considering GEO as one of your value stocks. Sunoco (SUN) Source: Gergely Zsolnai/Shutterstock.com Technically, Sunoco isn\u2019t exactly what you think about when you discuss value stocks. Indeed, Sunoco\u2019s P/E ratio is 21 times, which is notably higher than the median 16-times ratio seen in the oil and gas industry. But, as a countering statistic, the forward P/E ratio of SUN stock is 9.5 times, which is lower than the industry median 34-times ratio. So, what to do about Sunoco? Personally, I view the company as undervalued relative to its fundamentals. According to its website, Sunoco is one of the largest fuel distribution providers in the U.S. Obviously, that wasn\u2019t the most helpful sector to ply your trade in during the initial onslaught of the Covid-19 crisis. But with cases fading, the narrative for SUN stock has conversely improved significantly. 7 Hot Stocks to Buy Because of Soaring Sales As well, general reticence toward getting a Covid-19 vaccine may help the fuel distribution industry. These folks may not want to get vaccinated, but they might not want to take unnecessary risks either. Therefore, if they travel, they might do so by road, not by air. Value Stocks to Buy: Anheuser Busch (BUD) Source: legacy1995 / Shutterstock.com Admittedly, Anheuser Busch is a disappointment. It may very well be one of the most disappointing value stocks in the market. You\u2019d think that with the company controlling some very popular beer brands that BUD stock would perform much better than it has (not including the \u201csmall numbers comparison\u201d resulting from the initial Covid impact). Much of this has to do with changing demographics and consumer habits. Generally speaking, there\u2019s a shift among millennials and Generation Z to hard cider rather than beer. Also, it doesn\u2019t help that young people drink less alcohol than prior generations. Naturally, this had Anheuser Busch scrambling for answers. Now, this might be a stretch, but brewing economic factors may tilt the needle more favorably for BUD stock. According to Statista.com, U.S. household debt hit a new high. Largely, the culprit was mortgages. Thanks to a ridiculous housing market where people bid up available homes to the moon, individuals participating in the craze just don\u2019t have as much disposable income available. This may create an environment where beggars can\u2019t be choosers. You want to get buzzed? Forget your apple cider \u2014 it\u2019s Bud Light for you (yuck!).
