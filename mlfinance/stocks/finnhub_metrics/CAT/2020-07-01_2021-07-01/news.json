In the fiscal second quarter, CAT expects sales to improve in the Construction Industries segment, led by North America. The company also anticipates sales growth in the Energy and Transportation business and higher demand by end-users in resource industries like Heavy Construction and Mining.

While the company has been able to mitigate the issue so far, Bonfield said such shortages could mean Caterpillar may not be able to fully meet demand from its customers this year.Caterpillar\u2019s quarterly results surpassed Wall Street\u2019s expectations, with sales jumping 12% to $11.9 billion in the period and per-share adjusted earnings of $2.87 topping the $1.95 a share average estimate of analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Shares of Caterpillar fell 2.3% to $226.99 at 10:09 a.m. trading in New York.Caterpillar has been riding high on expectations for a sales recovery, with the stock coming off its best quarter in more than a decade in a bet on improving orders amid mass vaccine rollouts and signs of rebounding industrial demand.Other Takeaways:With global metal prices surging to multi-year and all-time highs, Caterpillar\u2019s CEO said during an earnings call that the company is seeing a \u201cgradual\u201d improvement in the pace of mining equipment sales.Construction in the U.S. and China remain the brightest spots for the company. Management said demand will continue growing in the U.S. while staying strong in China. Still, the company said they expect the second half to be more challenging in China because the Asian nation began recovering much sooner than the rest of the world.Dealer inventories grew, but executives don\u2019t expect a \u201csignificant\u201d increase through the rest of the year and the focus remains on producing closely to consumer demand.Caterpillar again chose not to give a full-year outlook, saying that uncertainty around the globe still remains, making it difficult to give specific forecasts for investors. The underlying message is that the recovery is real, but the pandemic is still a factor.(Adds key takeaways from earnings call, and share decline)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=9b789eaeb72e41ebe7e3f5b5ec7e3f13306b167c5dda1cfeb2a31ad928158eb0"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619704982, "headline": "Q1 GDP Increases Lower Than Expectations", "id": 67117089, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/abvxxpw_EhiJ5CndgtV9gg--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MzU7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/zacks.com/9507176d9255e9dd39381c57df9d94b3", "related": "CAT", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "Q1 GDP Increases Lower Than Expectations", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ba4cbb351646249ff337b1e3cd191c6d08617fbf252bfc99c6e868d220282649"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619703121, "headline": "Timken (TKR) Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates, Raises '21 Outlook", "id": 67117090, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lY3wr_2PWydraW.rjQZlyA--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MzU7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/zacks.com/6e0eea77024f8a02b541f11695d7c6a6", "related": "CAT", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "Timken (TKR) reported improvement in first-quarter earnings aided by growth across most end-market sectors.

It\u2019s also reducing shifts at its plant in Regensburg, Germany, this week.Honda Motor Co. will halt production at three plants in Japan for around five to six days next month, a spokesperson said Wednesday. And in the U.S., Ford Motor Co. reduced its full-year earnings forecast due to the debilitating chip shortage, which it now sees extending into next year. All told, the shortage will likely reduce production by 1.1 million vehicles this year, John Lawler, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said on a call with reporters.The shortfall of critically needed semiconductors has forced the entire auto industry to cut output, leaving thin inventories at dealerships just as consumers emerge from Covid-19 lockdowns. Surging demand for phones, laptops and electronics during the pandemic has overwhelmed chip suppliers -- Apple Inc. on Wednesday reported quarterly revenue that crushed Wall Street expectations, fueled by sales of the iPhone 12 line and purchases of iPads and Macs as people continue to work from home.Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk this week called the chip shortage a \u201chuge problem.\u201d NXP Semiconductors NV said it\u2019s expecting supply to be tight all year and warned constraints for the auto industry could extend into 2022.In just the past week, Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc, Volvo Group and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. have joined the list of carmakers idling factories. Consultant AlixPartners has said the chip shortage could cost automakers $61 billion in lost sales this year.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=20f8c75b24dc021223938b4e2144d9daea6de33136cf5ee68d25f72924f579c0"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619695860, "headline": "Fly Intel: Wall Street's top stories at midday AAPL;FB;F;MRNA;CAT;MCD;MRK;VER;O;NOK;ADVM;CARA", "id": 67118549, "image": "https://image.thefly.com/catalog/201810/img_66.png", "related": "CAT", "source": "Thefly.com", "summary": "<p>The major averages were stronger in early ...", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=9e5ccd4ccb77f2dba6f777defc0786d569830f7c820f64e08ad3f5b3b52d454f"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619695842, "headline": "Caterpillar Inc. 2021 Q1 - Results - Earnings Call Presentation", "id": 67113981, "image": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "related": "CAT", "source": "SeekingAlpha", "summary": "The following slide deck was published by Caterpillar Inc.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a5910b4dabbf78a017033e7f191bfebd3173d1c967df152487df6688cc2132e8"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619694300, "headline": "Caterpillar Earnings: A Street-Beating Quarter", "id": 67120862, "image": "", "related": "CAT", "source": "GuruFocus", "summary": "GuruFocus Article or News written by Mayank Marwah and the topic is about: Heavy equipment maker reported sales growth in all its business segments", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=6db2eb687ca0ea653b57806bf0cf4fb8601112bc93bcc48a2c8d26c9d7c94b6e"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619693958, "headline": "What President Biden's Big Speech Means for Investors", "id": 67115564, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2020/10/07/joe-biden-leah-millis-reuters.jpeg?924578600", "related": "CAT", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "What did the speech actually mean for America and, more importantly here, for investors?", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=642e8e07b3a456f9b2b57843e4958323c38a5aa04d28e35ebfaa7f5acab99458"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619693100, "headline": "Caterpillar shares jump 3% premarket as earnings blow past estimates", "id": 67117108, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/S8SCotpO9m2XQyQUIGU5dw--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/marketwatch.com/96d076434b2a015a3010bd2787b8c856", "related": "CAT", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "Caterpillar Inc. shares jumped 3% in premarket trade Thursday, after the maker of construction, energy and mining equipment blew past estimates for its first quarter.
