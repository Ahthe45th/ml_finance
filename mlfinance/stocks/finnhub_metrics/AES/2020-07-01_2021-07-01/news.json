Hence, the unmatched combination of income generation and profitability makes utility stocks an excellent low-risk option for investors.\nThis year, the utility stocks represented by the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLU), have underperformed the broader market.

Therefore, let\u2019s look at three utility stocks that remained resilient despite the effects of the pandemic.\nAmerican Water Works (NYSE:AWK)\nAES Corporation\u00a0(NYSE:AES)\nNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE)\n\nUtility Stocks: American Water Works (AWK)\nSource: Shutterstock\n\t\nAmerican Water Works provides regulated water and wastewater services to homeowners and the military. It is currently the largest water and wastewater utility company in the U.S.\nAdditionally, it also makes money using specific market-based activities. It remained resilient in the face of the pandemic, as AWK stock grew 13.7% relative to the S&P 500.\nIt recently reported its solid second-quarter results. Earnings per share (EPS) for six months ended June 30 was at $1.65, roughly 5.8% compared to the prior-year period. Income from its regulated business was $177 million, compared to $156 million in the same period last year.\nAdditionally, income from market-based activities also increased by $2 million. Despite the slowdown in water usage in the country, the increase in prices has helped offset revenues\u2019 impact.\nMoreover, the directors announced a quarterly cash dividend payment of 55 cents per share. Hence, the dividend growth rate for the past year for the company is around 10%. American Water Works expects to grow its EPS and dividends at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 7% to 10%\u00a0from 2019 to 2024.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE)\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\t\nNextEra Energy is the most valuable energy company in terms of market capitalization in the U.S. It runs regulated electric utilities in Florida and a nonregulated energy business operating natural gas and renewable energy projects.\nAdditionally, it boasts one of the most robust financial profiles in the sector, with the highest credit ratings among businesses of its kind. NEE stock\u2019s 12-month return relative to the S&P 500 is at a healthy 19.3%.\nThe company reported its second-quarter results back in July, which was weighed down by the pandemic. The adjusted EPS for the quarter was at $2.61, surpassing expectations by 4.4%. However, revenues were down 15.4%. Revenues across all its segments lagged behind consensus estimates. Nevertheless, the company\u2019s earnings are expected to grow at a CAGR of 6% to 8% per year through 2021.\n7 Airline Stocks to Buy on Pelosi Stimulus Hopes\nIts financial strength continues to impress as cash and cash equivalents were up 268% crossing the $1 billion mark. Moreover, the company plans to increase its dividend by approximately 10% per year through 2022.\n\nAES Corporation (AES)\nSource: zhao jiankang / Shutterstock.com\n\t\nAES is one of the largest electric utility companies in the U.S. operating in multiple nations. It has one of the most diversified portfolios of distribution and electricity generation businesses.\nAdditionally, it is among the top electric utility companies leading the charge towards renewable energy. AES stock\u2019s 12-month return relative to the S&P 500 is at a solid 10.9%.\nThe pandemic weighed down the company\u2019s second-quarter results. Adjusted EPS was down 3.8% to 25 cents while revenues dropped 11.3%. Despite the slowdown, the management feels that market demand is better than their expectations, and collections are in line with historical levels. The company expects a 7% to 9% average growth rate for its business through to 2022.\nAES is betting heavily on the green revolution and hopes to generate less than 10% of its electricity from coal by 2030. It is aggressively retiring its coal plants and remains focused on increasing its renewable plants.\n On\u00a0the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWhy Everyone Is Investing in 5G All WRONG\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTop Stock Picker Reveals His Next 1,000% Winner\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRadical New Battery Could Dismantle Oil Markets\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRevolutionary Tech Behind 5G Rollout Is Being Pioneered By This 1 Company\t\t\t\t\n\nThe post 3 Utility Stocks With Tried-and-True Gains appeared first on InvestorPlace.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=1a5a87ff6ba6d2b1af8f2938f5516be36792116126118ece7e40201ec1bbf648"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1603469567, "headline": "3 Utility Stocks With Tried-and-True Gains", "id": 61115732, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?825625561", "related": "AES", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3d3f16499d0b1051b450bd4ab51b2bf54ba35c659d69d683563fd9ed8d10fa69"}, {"category": "company news", "datetime": 1603469567, "headline": "3 Utility Stocks With Tried-and-True Gains", "id": 59153352, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?1716166085", "related": "AES", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=6c3104e34034b24f8eda457d4f0d0864a053cdeab00af01b04e567e25624c2f4"}, {"category": "company news", "datetime": 1603462800, "headline": "DP&L reaches comprehensive settlement agreement resolving numerous cases including its Smart Grid Plan", "id": 55229884, "image": "", "related": "AES", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "Dayton Power & Light Company (DP&L), a subsidiary of the AES Corporation (NYSE:AES), has filed a nearly unanimous stipulation (Stipulation) to invest $249 million in capital projects over the next four years providing direct customer benefits through modernizing the electric grid and building a smarter energy future for customers.

(\"CdA\u201d) and AES Gener S.A (\u201cAES Gener\u201d), have entered into a long-term power purchase agreement to provide 100% renewable power for Teck\u2019s Carmen de Andacollo Operation in Chile.Under the agreement, CdA will source 72 Megawatts (MW) (550 GWh/year) from AES Gener\u2019s growing renewable portfolio of wind, solar and hydroelectric energy. The transition to renewable power will replace previous fossil fuel power sources and eliminate approximately 200,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually, the equivalent to removing over 40,000 passenger vehicles from the road.\u201cTeck is tackling the global challenge of climate change by reducing the carbon footprint of our operations and working towards our goal of becoming carbon neutral,\u201d said Don Lindsay, President and CEO of Teck. \u201cThis agreement takes Teck a step closer to achieving our sustainability goals, while also ensuring a reliable, long-term clean power supply for CdA at a reduced cost to Teck.\u201d\u201cWe are honored to continue working together with Teck to help them progress towards their goal of carbon neutrality,\u201d said Andr\u00e9s Gluski, AES Corporation President and Chief Executive Officer. \u201cBy providing Teck with innovative renewable energy solutions, AES Gener is helping build Chile\u2019s sustainable and reliable grid of the future.\u201dAs part of its updated Sustainability Strategy, Teck has set the goal of being a carbon neutral operator by 2050.

In the first half of the year, demand fell sharply. The lockdown policies put in place to halt the spread of the coronavirus had a major part in that \u2013 but demand was likely to fall anyway, from a producer perspective, as the global stockpiles were nearing capacity. The combination of both factors delivered a massive one-two punch to the industry.This doesn\u2019t mean that investors can\u2019t find deals among the oil companies. RBC, Canada\u2019s premier investment bank, has long had its pulse on oil stocks \u2013 Canada is the world\u2019s fifth largest crude producer, and what happens to the oil industry will impact our northern neighbor. In response, RBC has reported on its Best Ideas in the global \u2013 and North American \u2013 energy markets for 2020.We ran three of the firm\u2019s Best Ideas through\u00a0TipRanks\u2019\u00a0database\u00a0to get a better sense of the broader analyst community\u2019s opinion. We revealed that the Street is overwhelmingly bullish on all of the names, with each earning a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d consensus rating.\u00a0AES Corporation (AES)The first company on our list, AES, is a diversified energy provider. The company owns and operates, through development and acquisition, a network of power generation plants and distribution systems in 14 countries. AES has a portfolio of assets worth over $34 billion, and brought in revenues of $10 billion in 2019.All of this gave the company a solid foundation when the coronavirus hit. AES kept its earnings positive during the first half, and while Q2 EPS was sequentially lower than Q1, the first quarter figure missed the forecast where the second quarter number showed a beat. Looking ahead, AES is expected to see third quarter earnings rise sharply as normal economic activity resumes.Reviewing this stock for RBC, 5-star analyst Shelby Tucker likes the company\u2019s prospects. He writes, \u201cGeneration remains highly contracted and is resilient to near-term demand weakness [...] The company is on track to achieve investment grade ratings from S&P and Moody\u2019s despite the effects of COVID-19, in our view. [...] The pandemic-induced sell-off creates an attractive entry point, in our view. AES currently trades at 7.8x EV/EBITDA relative to 11.3x for utilities.\"To this end, Tucker gives AES a Buy rating, and his $20 price target suggests a 14% upside to the stock in the coming year. (To watch Tucker\u2019s track record, click here)While the stock has a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, based on 5 Buys compared to 1 Hold, the average price target, at $18.60, implies a modest 5.5% upside from the $17.62 trading price. (See AES stock analysis on TipRanks)Cheniere Energy (LNG)The next company on our list of RBC picks is Cheniere Energy. This Texas-based firm is a leading producer of liquified natural gas (LNG), a less volatile and more easily transported form of the natural gas produced in copious quantities by the oil industry. Natural gas is a cleaner-burning fuel compared to other petroleum products, and plays an important role in reducing emissions. The liquified form is the primary way in which it is shipped into the markets.Cheniere owns and operates the infrastructure needed to liquify the gas and load it for transport. The company owns rail cars and pipelines for overland transport in the US; shipments overseas are loaded at the company\u2019s Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi terminal facilities.While depressed demand has hurt Cheniere\u2019s stock price, holding it down in recent weeks, the company\u2019s contract for service structure has allowed it to maintain earnings during the corona crisis. LNG beat the forecasts on earnings in both Q1 and Q2 of 2020, despite a 20% fall-off in revenue during the first half of the year.Elvira Scotto, another 5-star analyst from RBC, is impressed with Cheniere, especially its ability to keep up business. She writes of the company\u2019s business model, \u201cCheniere has long-term take-or-pay contracts on 85% of its nine-train portfolio capacity. All of Cheniere\u2019s Sale and Purchase Agreement customers are investment grade rated or have investment grade credit metrics. Importantly, utilities or state-owned utilities/oil and gas companies represent 68% of Cheniere\u2019s contracted capacity.\u201dScotto believes that Cheniere\u2019s current low share price represents an opportunity, saying \u201cwe still see value\u201d in the stock. Her price target of $65 indicates her confidence in a 26% one-year upside to the stock, and supports her Buy rating. (To watch Scotto\u2019s track record, click here)LNG has a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus, and it is unanimous \u2013 no fewer than 6 positive reviews have been received in the last three months. Shares are selling for $52.25, and the average price target, $65.83, is slightly more bullish than Scotto\u2019s; it suggests an upside potential of 27% for Cheniere Energy. (See LNG stock analysis on TipRanks)Enviva Partners LP (EVA)The last of RBC\u2019s energy picks on today\u2019s list is Enviva Partners, a company squarely in the \u2018green energy\u2019 sector. Enviva produces processed biomass fuel, a type of wood pellet sold as power generation fuel to industrial customers. Biomass pellets burn cleaner than coal, and provide a productive way to dispose of sawdust, woodchips, and other common waste from the lumber sector.Enviva\u2019s production facilities are located in the Southeast, but the company is mainly an exporter. Of the 3 million tons of annual pellet production, most gets sent overseas to the UK and Europe. Plants using the biomass pellets saw an 80% reduction in carbon emissions on average.Despite a sharp drop in earnings in the first half, Enviva has seen a strong share price recovery from the market collapse of February/March. Shares bottomed out on March 23, but have since nearly doubled. Since the current cycle began on February 20, EVA is up 14%, outperforming the S&P 500 over the same period. Reflecting another good sign for investors, last week, EVA announced its regular dividend payment, of 76.5 cents per share, will be paid out at the end of this month. The move marked the twentieth consecutive increase in the company\u2019s dividend, which currently yields 7.3%.EVA shares were reviewed by RBC's Elvira Scotto, noted above, who was impressed with the company\u2019s steady production. She wrote, \u201cEVA's production facilities have continued to run normally through the pandemic and EVA has not witnessed any issues in its supply chain. In addition, customers continue to take product\u2026\u201d Scotto adds that, \u201cBased on total contracted revenue backlog of ~$19 billion, EVA plans to more than double its 2019 EBITDA in the next couple of years.\u201dIn line with her comments, Scotto rates EVA shares a Buy. Her $46 price target suggests an upside potential of 9.5%.Enviva\u2019s recent share appreciation has pushed the stock price right up next to the average price target of $43, resulting in a modest upside potential of 2.41%. EVA is currently trading at $42. The stock has a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 3 Buys and 1 Hold.

AES kept its earnings positive during the first half, and while Q2 EPS was sequentially lower than Q1, the first quarter figure missed the forecast where the second quarter number showed a beat. Looking ahead, AES is expected to see third quarter earnings rise sharply as normal economic activity resumes.\n\n\n\nReviewing this stock for RBC, 5-star analyst Shelby Tucker likes the company\u2019s prospects. He writes, \u201cGeneration remains highly contracted and is resilient to near-term demand weakness [...] The company is on track to achieve investment grade ratings from S&P and Moody\u2019s despite the effects of COVID-19, in our view. [...] The pandemic-induced sell-off creates an attractive entry point, in our view. AES currently trades at 7.8x EV/EBITDA relative to 11.3x for utilities.\"\n\n\n\nTo this end, Tucker gives AES a Buy rating, and his $20 price target suggests a 14% upside to the stock in the coming year. (To watch Tucker\u2019s track record, click here)\n\n\n\nWhile the stock has a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, based on 5 Buys compared to 1 Hold, the average price target, at $18.60, implies a modest 5.5% upside from the $17.62 trading price. (See AES stock analysis on TipRanks)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheniere Energy (LNG)\n\n\n\nThe next company on our list of RBC picks is Cheniere Energy. This Texas-based firm is a leading producer of liquified natural gas (LNG), a less volatile and more easily transported form of the natural gas produced in copious quantities by the oil industry. Natural gas is a cleaner-burning fuel compared to other petroleum products, and plays an important role in reducing emissions. The liquified form is the primary way in which it is shipped into the markets.\n\n\n\nCheniere owns and operates the infrastructure needed to liquify the gas and load it for transport. The company owns rail cars and pipelines for overland transport in the US; shipments overseas are loaded at the company\u2019s Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi terminal facilities.\n\n\n\nWhile depressed demand has hurt Cheniere\u2019s stock price, holding it down in recent weeks, the company\u2019s contract for service structure has allowed it to maintain earnings during the corona crisis. LNG beat the forecasts on earnings in both Q1 and Q2 of 2020, despite a 20% fall-off in revenue during the first half of the year.\n\n\n\nElvira Scotto, another 5-star analyst from RBC, is impressed with Cheniere, especially its ability to keep up business. She writes of the company\u2019s business model, \u201cCheniere has long-term take-or-pay contracts on 85% of its nine-train portfolio capacity. All of Cheniere\u2019s Sale and Purchase Agreement customers are investment grade rated or have investment grade credit metrics. Importantly, utilities or state-owned utilities/oil and gas companies represent 68% of Cheniere\u2019s contracted capacity.\u201d\n\n\n\nScotto believes that Cheniere\u2019s current low share price represents an opportunity, saying \u201cwe still see value\u201d in the stock. Her price target of $65 indicates her confidence in a 26% one-year upside to the stock, and supports her Buy rating. (To watch Scotto\u2019s track record, click here)\n\n\n\nLNG has a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus, and it is unanimous \u2013 no fewer than 6 positive reviews have been received in the last three months. Shares are selling for $52.25, and the average price target, $65.83, is slightly more bullish than Scotto\u2019s; it suggests an upside potential of 27% for Cheniere Energy. (See LNG stock analysis on TipRanks)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnviva Partners LP (EVA)\n\n\n\nThe last of RBC\u2019s energy picks on today\u2019s list is Enviva Partners, a company squarely in the \u2018green energy\u2019 sector. Enviva produces processed biomass fuel, a type of wood pellet sold as power generation fuel to industrial customers. Biomass pellets burn cleaner than coal, and provide a productive way to dispose of sawdust, woodchips, and other common waste from the lumber sector.\n\n\n\nEnviva\u2019s production facilities are located in the Southeast, but the company is mainly an exporter. Of the 3 million tons of annual pellet production, most gets sent overseas to the UK and Europe. Plants using the biomass pellets saw an 80% reduction in carbon emissions on average.\n\n\n\nDespite a sharp drop in earnings in the first half, Enviva has seen a strong share price recovery from the market collapse of February/March. Shares bottomed out on March 23, but have since nearly doubled. Since the current cycle began on February 20, EVA is up 14%, outperforming the S&P 500 over the same period. Reflecting another good sign for investors, last week, EVA announced its regular dividend payment, of 76.5 cents per share, will be paid out at the end of this month. The move marked the twentieth consecutive increase in the company\u2019s dividend, which currently yields 7.3%.\n\n\n\nEVA shares were reviewed by RBC's Elvira Scotto, noted above, who was impressed with the company\u2019s steady production. She wrote, \u201cEVA's production facilities have continued to run normally through the pandemic and EVA has not witnessed any issues in its supply chain. In addition, customers continue to take product\u2026\u201d Scotto adds that, \u201cBased on total contracted revenue backlog of ~$19 billion, EVA plans to more than double its 2019 EBITDA in the next couple of years.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn line with her comments, Scotto rates EVA shares a Buy. Her $46 price target suggests an upside potential of 9.5%.\n\n\n\nEnviva\u2019s recent share appreciation has pushed the stock price right up next to the average price target of $43, resulting in a modest upside potential of 2.41%. EVA is currently trading at $42. The stock has a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 3 Buys and 1 Hold.
