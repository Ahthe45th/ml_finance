Here is Benzinga's essential guide to Expeditors International's Q4 earnings report. Net Income, Earnings, And Earnings Per Share Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings also known as net income is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS. Earnings And Revenue Expeditors International EPS will likely be near $1.07 while revenue will be around $2.49 billion, according to analysts. Expeditors International EPS in the same period a year ago totaled $0.79. Revenue was $2.04 billion. What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the \"consensus estimates\"; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an \"earnings surprise\", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values. View more earnings on EXPD If the company were to post earnings in line with the consensus estimate when it reports Tuesday, EPS would be up 35.44%. Sales would be up 21.76% on a year-over-year basis. Here is how the company's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past: Quarter Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 EPS Estimate 0.98 0.71 0.64 0.87 EPS Actual 1.12 1.09 0.71 0.79 Revenue Estimate 2.36 B 1.85 B 1.80 B 2.15 B Revenue Actual 2.46 B 2.58 B 1.90 B 2.04 B Stock Performance Shares of Expeditors International were trading at $95.85 as of February 11.
