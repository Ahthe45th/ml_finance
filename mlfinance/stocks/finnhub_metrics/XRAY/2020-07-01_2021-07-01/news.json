That\u2019s based on 5 Buys versus 3 Holds. The average analyst price target of $73.75 implies 11.3% upside potential to current levels.

These Non-GAAP measures may differ from those used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The Company discloses these measures to allow investors to evaluate the performance of the Company\u2019s operations exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period and which may not be indicative of past or future performance of the normal operations of the Company. The Company believes that this information is helpful in understanding underlying operating results including net sales, operating income, and net income. Organic Sales The Company defines \"organic sales\" as the increase or decrease in net sales excluding: (1) net sales from acquired and divested businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition or divestiture, (2) net sales attributable to discontinued product lines in both the current and prior year periods, and (3) the impact of foreign currency translation, which is calculated by translating current period sales using the comparable prior periods currency conversion rates. Organic sales is an important internal measure for the Company. The Company's senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes organic sales and the performance of the Company is measured on this metric along with other performance metrics. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Per Diluted Common Share The adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Dentsply Sirona consists of net income (loss) attributable to Dentsply Sirona adjusted to exclude the following: (1) Business combination related costs and fair value adjustments. These adjustments include costs related to consummating and integrating acquired businesses, as well as net gains and losses related to the disposed businesses. In addition, this category includes the subsequent impact roll-off to the consolidated statements of operations which results from fair value adjustments related to business combinations, except for amortization expense of purchased intangible assets noted below. Although the Company is regularly engaged in activities to find and act on opportunities for strategic growth and enhancement of product offerings, the costs associated with these activities may vary significantly between periods based on the timing, size and complexity of acquisitions and as such may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company. They are therefore excluded to allow investors to better understand underlying operating trends. (2) Restructuring program related costs and other costs. These adjustments include costs related to the implementation of restructuring initiatives as well as certain other costs. These costs can include, but are not limited to, severance costs, facility closure costs, lease and contract termination costs and related professional service costs, duplicate facility and labor costs associated with specific restructuring initiatives. Other costs include legal settlements and impairments of assets. The Company's restructuring programs usually require several years to fully implement and the Company is continually seeking to take actions that could enhance its efficiency. While restructuring charges are recurring, they are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to the varying levels of restructuring activity and the inherent imprecision in the estimates used to recognize the impairment of assets and the wide variety of costs and taxes associated with severance and termination benefits in the countries in which the restructuring actions occur. (3) Amortization of purchased intangible assets. This adjustment excludes the periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets recorded in purchase accounting. Although these costs contribute to revenue generation and will recur in future periods, their amounts are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions. (4) Credit risk and fair value adjustments. These adjustments include both the cost and income impacts of adjustments in certain assets and liabilities including the Company\u2019s pension obligations, that are recorded through net income which are related to the changes in fair value and credit risk. Although this non-service component of pension expense is a recurring item, it is subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to changes in actuarial assumptions, global financial markets (including stock market returns and interest rate changes), plan changes, settlements, curtailments, and other changes in facts and circumstances. These items can be variable and driven more by market conditions than the Company\u2019s operating performance. (5) Income tax related adjustments. These adjustments include both income tax expenses and income tax benefits that are representative of income tax adjustments mostly related to prior periods, as well as the final settlement of income tax audits, and discrete tax items resulting from the implementation of restructuring initiatives and the vesting and exercise of employee share-based compensation. Income tax related adjustments may also include the impact to adjust the interim effective income tax rate to the expected annual effective tax rate. These adjustments are irregular in timing the variability in amounts may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and therefore are excluded for comparability purposes. Both adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted EPS are important internal measures for the Company. The Company's senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted EPS. The performance of the Company is measured on these metrics along with other performance metrics. Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) and Margin In addition to reporting operating income (loss) in accordance with US GAAP, the Company provides adjusted operating income (loss) and margin. The Company defines \"adjusted operating income (loss)\" as operating income (loss) in accordance with US GAAP excluding certain items noted above which are excluded on a pre-tax basis to arrive at adjusted operating income (loss), a Non-GAAP measure. The adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income (loss) by net sales. Both adjusted operating income (loss) and adjusted operating margin are important internal measures for the Company. The Company's senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes adjusted operating income (loss) and margin. The performance of the Company is measured on these metrics along with the adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted EPS metrics noted above as well as other performance metrics. DENTSPLY SIRONA INC.

(\u201cDentsply\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NASDAQ: XRAY) on behalf of the Company\u2019s long-term stockholders. Recently a securities fraud complaint was filed against Dentsply in federal court on behalf of investors who purchased shares of the Company\u2019s stock between February 20, 2014 and August 7, 2018. According to the complaint, during that time period Dentsply and certain of the Company\u2019s senior executive officers engaged in a \u201cyears-long scheme\u201d to conceal from the market the Company\u2019s true financial and operating condition. As further alleged in the complaint, Dentsply\u2019s investors learned the truth about the Company\u2019s financial condition through a series of corrective disclosures that revealed: (i) the dire impact of the inventory backlog caused by the minimum purchase requirements on the Company\u2019s revenues, margins and earnings; (ii) that the SEC had opened an investigation into the Company\u2019s accounting and disclosures \u201crelating to transactions with a significant distributor of the Company\u201d; and (iii) billion dollar impairments to the Company\u2019s goodwill that resulted from the inventory backlog. In total, Dentsply\u2019s stock price declined over 45% in value from its Class Period high following the disclosures about the Company\u2019s true financial and operating condition. The firm\u2019s investigation seeks to determine whether the members of Dentsply\u2019s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties to Dentsply and its stockholders in connection with the above alleged misconduct. Current Dentsply stockholders who purchased or acquired shares of the company\u2019s stock prior to August 7, 2018 are encouraged to contact Kaskela Law LLC (D. Seamus Kaskela, Esq.) at (484) 258 \u2013 1585, or by email at skaskela@kaskelalaw.com or online at https://kaskelalaw.com/case/dentsply/, to discuss this investigation and their legal rights and options.

famously convicted of illegal insider trading after getting a stock tip on a biopharma company.But there is plenty of insider trading that can be conducted based on information in the public realm, even if it is generally known mainly by corporate officers or company directors. In that case, as long as the insiders publish their trades in timely fashion, in accordance with SEC rules, the insider trades are perfectly legal.The SEC rules don\u2019t make the insiders\u2019 knowledge more readily available, but they do make the insiders\u2019 trades easy to follow. And following corporate officers, to see what trades they make and when, can make a viable strategy for retail investors. Bearing this in mind, we\u2019ve used data from the TipRanks Insiders\u2019 Hot Stocks tool to find three stocks that are showing recent \u2013 and informative \u2013 insider buys. A dive into the stock data and the analyst commentary may provide some additional insight.Dominion Energy, Inc. (D)We\u2019re starting in the energy industry, with a power utility company. Richmond, Virginia-based Dominion has its hands in the electricity and natural gas sectors, with electric utility customers in Virginia and both Carolinas, and natural gas customers in West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, the Carolinas, and Georgia, along with parts of Utah out west.The past year has not been kind to Dominion, and EPS is down from 2019. In the recently reported Q4, the company reported GAAP earnings of 82 cents per share, down a significant 32% from the $1.21 reported in 4Q19.\u00a0 Full year earnings showed a worse picture, with a 57-cent net loss per share compared the $1.62 EPS profit in 2019.While 2020 showed losses for Dominion, the company did not attribute those losses to the corona crisis. Rather, the company noted several business factors that depressed earnings: charges due to planned retirement of electricity generation plants in Virginia; cancellation of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline project; and lost operations due to the sale of the company\u2019s Gas Transmission and Storage segment. These are all one-time charges, and in some respects offer the long-term benefit of streamlining business. Dominion guided 2021 full-year earnings to the range of $3.70 to $4.00 per share.Despite the mixed results of 2020, Dominion has seen some recent insider purchases that are pushing the insider sentiment needle into positive territory. President and CEO Robert Blue spent nearly $1 million on 14,442 shares of Dominion, while Board of Directors member Mark Kington made a smaller purchase of 2,000 shares, paying $138,578.Dominion has scored fans within the analyst community as well. Analyst Jeremy Tonet, from JPMorgan, covers Dominion Energy, and sees strength ahead for the company, in light of its ability to tack the political winds and shift to non-fossil fuel operations. \u201cWith 52% of Dominion growth allocated to zero-carbon investments, D\u2019s leverage to \u2018green rate of change\u2019 leads most peer utilities and should drive a multiple re-rating over time. Importantly, the VA regulatory construct limits D\u2019s offshore wind project risk relative to other industry participants given cost prudency presumption,\u201d Tonet wrote.To this end, Tonet rates D an Overweight (i.e. Buy) and puts an $87 price target on the stock, implying an upside of 15% for the coming year. (To watch Tonet\u2019s track record, click here)The 6 to 2 breakdown on recent stock reviews, in favor of Buy versus Hold, shows that Wall Street generally agrees with Tonet here, and makes the analyst consensus rating a Strong Buy. Shares in D are priced at $73.21, and their $81.50 average price target suggests an 11% upside from that level. (See Dominion stock analysis on TipRanks)Keurig Dr. Pepper (KDP)In these corona days, we should check in with a Doctor. Dr. Pepper, actually \u2013 a long-known brand in the food and beverage industry. The company owns over 55 brands of coffee, along with 20 flavored soda brands \u2013 including Dr. Pepper, 7Up, and A&W Root Beer \u2013 as well as an array of bottled waters, teas, juices, and mixers. Keurig Dr. Pepper is the 8th largest food and beverage company in the US, and saw more than $11 billion in total sales in 2020.While the company\u2019s top-line revenues grew year-over-year in every quarter of 2020, earnings missed expectations in 4Q20 (EPS came in at 30 cents, against a 39-cent forecast). Yet, the company showed its confidence by increasing the regularly quarterly dividend by 25%, to 75 cents per share. At $3 per share annualized, this gives a yield of 2.27%. In early March, Board member \u2013 and corporate insider \u2013 Robert Singer made 4 informative purchases of KDP shares. Singer paid nearly $500,000 for a total of 9,500 shares. 5-star analyst Nik Modi appears to echo the Director\u2019s sentiment. Providing key takeaways from the fourth-quarter, Modi noted: \u201cStrong quarter for KDP with continued momentum in coffee and gains in packaged beverages. This quarter is another data point suggesting KDP is well positioned for 2021 and beyond. The dividend was also very positive news. We believe KDP has a very unique combination of strong underlying growth and significant balance sheet optionality.\"Based on the above, Modi rates KDP an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with a $37 price target. This figure indicates a 10% upside potential from current levels. (To watch Modi\u2019s track record, click here)Wall Street\u2019s analyst corps are somewhat divided here, as shown by the Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 3 Buys and 2 Holds. KDP shares are priced at $33.56, and the $36.75 average price target implies a 9.5% upside for the year ahead. (See KDP stock analysis on TipRanks)Dentsply Sirona, Inc. (XRAY)We\u2019ll conclude in the medical supply sector, where Dentsply is a major maker of dental equipment and dental health consumable. The company boasts annual revenues near $4 billion, based on equipment sales and educational services, and also has an active research program in the dental health field. Dentsply Sirona has global reach, with manufacturing facilities in 21 countries and marketing reach more than 120.The Q4 results showed $1.08 billion at the top line, compared to $1.11 billion in the prior year quarter, with EPS of 45 cents just 1-cent down from the year-ago quarter. Turning to the inside trades, Board member Gregory Lucier bought 5,000 shares of the stock on Mach 4, paying $294,750. Following the purchase, the Director now holds 23,142 shares, which are valued at $1.43 million.On the analyst front, Piper Sandler analyst Jason Bednar sums up the bull case for XRAY in his recent note on the stock: \u201c[The] stock isn't getting enough credit for the visibility that management is providing... With a solid financial path to now follow and with management continuing to execute methodically towards its intermediate- to long-term financial targets, the ownership case for shares of XRAY remains attractive, in our opinion...\"Taking all of this into consideration, Bednar stays with the bulls. The analyst rates XRAY an Overweight (i.e. Buy) along with a $70 price target, which implies ~12% upside from current levels. (To watch Bednar\u2019s track record, click here)As for the rest of the Street, the bulls have it. XRAY's Moderate Buy consensus rating breaks down into 8 Buys, 4 Holds and 1 Sell received in the last three months. However, shares are selling for $62.06 and their recent appreciation has pushed them almost to the $63.67 average price target.

Dentsply (XRAY) expects the deal to be immediately accretive to its revenue growth rate and non-GAAP EPS in 2021. The acquisition is projected to generate non-GAAP EPS accretion of at least $0.05 in 2021 and be incrementally accretive in the years thereafter. The net present value of the tax benefits associated with the transaction is estimated to be about $160 million.The transaction, which closed on December 31, 2020, was funded with cash on Dentsply\u2019s balance sheet.Byte has developed an online business model for the direct-to-consumer clear aligner market.\u00a0The company\u2019s doctor-directed system provides customers with access to at-home clear aligners kits for teeth. Headquartered in Los Angeles, Byte has over 450 employees and runs a nationwide network of licensed dentists and orthodontists that prescribe and oversee every customer\u2019s treatment plan.Jorge Gomez, Dentsply\u2019s CFO commented, \u201cAs we bring the two businesses together, we are confident that we can unlock incremental growth and further capitalize on the increasing consumer demand for clear aligner solutions. In addition, we expect the acquisition to be accretive to Dentsply Sirona\u2019s long-term financial commitments as we continue to focus on driving growth and value for our shareholders.\u201d\u00a0Dentsply said that the acquisition comes amid expectations that the clear aligner market will increase at a 20%-25% growth rate in coming years. The company expects Byte to generate 2021 run-rate sales of at least $200 million. Combined with the SureSmile business, which has a projected revenue run-rate of $100 million by the end of 2021, Dentsply now forecasted the combined clear aligner revenue run-rate to triple to more than $300 million by the end of this year.Commenting on the deal announcement, Barrington Research analyst Michael Petusky, said that \u201cin addition to the materially enhanced scale, this transaction allows the company to more fully participate in a marketplace that is likely growing faster than any other in dental.\u201d \u00a0However, Petusky continued to maintain a Hold rating on the stock as although he likes the transaction and believes that it \u201cholds the promise of helping the company to both accelerate its top line and drive margin expansion, we do not see the current valuation of XRAY as super-compelling given the near-term uncertainties associated with a still very challenging COVID-19 backdrop.\u201d (See XRAY stock analysis on TipRanks)Overall, the rest of the Street is in line with Petusky\u2019s outlook. The Hold analyst consensus is based on 5 Holds, 1 Sell and 3 Buys. The average price target stands at $55 and indicates 2.3% upside potential over the coming 12 months.Related News:Canadian Railway Announces Grain Shipping Record for 10th Successive MonthSVB Financial To Buy Boston Private For $900M; Shares Pop 24%Bank OZK Hikes Dividend; Street Is Cautiously Optimistic", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=66318d02c6f56ebf6da0bfb8d5f265d555b0dbf3f1865ad4b8af46697c7c8d6e"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1609834172, "headline": "DENTSPLY SIRONA Reaches Analyst Target Price", "id": 62148729, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?1858804278", "related": "XRAY", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "In recent trading, shares of DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc (Symbol: XRAY) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $52.55, changing hands for $53.75/share.

This Non-GAAP measure may differ from those used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP. Organic sales is an important internal measure for the Company. The Company's senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes organic sales. The performance of the Company is measured on this metric along with other performance metrics.The Company discloses organic sales to allow investors to evaluate the performance of the Company\u2019s operations exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period and may not be indicative of past or future performance of the normal operations of the Company. The Company believes that this information is helpful in understanding underlying net sales trends.Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Per Diluted Common ShareIn addition to reporting net income (loss) attributable to Dentsply Sirona and earnings (loss) per diluted common share in accordance with US GAAP, the Company provides adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted common share (\u201cadjusted EPS\u201d) measures. The Company defines \"adjusted net income (loss)\" as net income (loss) attributable to Dentsply Sirona excluding certain items as noted below. Adjusted EPS is calculated by dividing adjusted net income (loss) by diluted common shares outstanding.The adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Dentsply Sirona consists of net income (loss) attributable to Dentsply Sirona adjusted to exclude the following:(1) Business combination related costs and fair value adjustments. These adjustments include costs related to integrating and consummating mergers and recently acquired businesses, as well as costs, gains and losses related to the disposal of businesses or significant product lines. In addition, this category includes the roll off to the consolidated statements of operations of fair value adjustments related to business combinations, except for amortization expense noted below. These items are irregular in timing and as such may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and are therefore excluded to allow investors to better understand underlying operating trends.(2) Restructuring program related costs and other costs. These adjustments include costs related to the implementation of restructuring initiatives as well as certain other costs. These costs can include, but are not limited to, severance costs, facility closure costs, lease and contract termination costs, related professional service costs, duplicate facility and labor costs associated with specific restructuring initiatives, as well as legal settlements and impairments of assets. These items are irregular in timing, amount and impact to the Company\u2019s financial performance. As such, these items may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and are therefore excluded for the purpose of understanding underlying operating trends.(3) Amortization of purchased intangible assets. This adjustment excludes the periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets. Amortization expense has been excluded from adjusted net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona to allow investors to evaluate and understand operating trends excluding these large non-cash charges.(4) Credit risk and fair value adjustments. These adjustments include both the cost and income impacts of adjustments in certain assets and liabilities including the Company\u2019s pension obligations, that are recorded through net income which are due solely to the changes in fair value and credit risk. These items can be variable and driven more by market conditions than the Company\u2019s operating performance. As such, these items may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and therefore are excluded for comparability purposes.(5) Income tax related adjustments. These adjustments include both income tax expenses and income tax benefits that are representative of income tax adjustments mostly related to prior periods, as well as the final settlement of income tax audits, and discrete tax items resulting from the implementation of restructuring initiatives and the vesting and exercise of employee share-based compensation. These adjustments are irregular in timing and amount and may significantly impact the Company\u2019s operating performance. As such, these items may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and therefore are excluded for comparability purposes.The \"adjusted net income (loss)\" and \"adjusted EPS\" measures are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States; therefore, these items represent Non-GAAP measures. These Non-GAAP measures may differ from those used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP. Income tax related adjustments may include the impact to adjust the interim effective income tax rate to the expected annual effective tax rate.Both adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted EPS are important internal measures for the Company. The Company's senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted EPS. The performance of the Company is measured on these metrics along with other performance metrics.The Company discloses adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted EPS to allow investors to evaluate the performance of the Company\u2019s operations exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period and may not be indicative of past or future performance of the normal operations of the Company and certain large non-cash charges related to intangible assets either purchased or acquired through a business combination. The Company believes that this information is helpful in understanding underlying operating trends and cash flow generation.Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) and MarginIn addition to reporting operating income (loss) in accordance with US GAAP, the Company provides adjusted operating income (loss) and margin. The Company defines \"adjusted operating income (loss)\" as operating income (loss) in accordance with US GAAP excluding certain items noted above which are excluded on a pre-tax basis to arrive at adjusted operating income (loss), a Non-GAAP measure. The adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income (loss) by net sales.The \"adjusted operating income (loss)\" and \"adjusted operating margin\" measures are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States; therefore, these items represent Non-GAAP measures. These Non-GAAP measures may differ from those used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP.Both adjusted operating income (loss) and adjusted operating margin are important internal measures for the Company. The Company's senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes adjusted operating income (loss) and margin.

The stock price moved down to $48.17 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2020-11-20  * Strike Price: $42.50  * Volume: 0  * Open Interest: 145Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer).The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are \"out of the money\" are also indicative of unusual options activity. \"Out of the money\" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are \"bullish\" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are \"bearish\" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For October 22, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

We have been encouraged to see continued improvement in sales trends, as dental offices reopen and patients return. To address the challenges posed by the pandemic, Dentsply Sirona has taken a number of steps focused on employee safety, customer service and securing the financial position of the Company. Today, to better position the Company for the future, we are initiating a series of additional restructuring actions that will enhance revenue growth, expand margins, and simplify the organization.

Foreign currency decreased sales by 0.9%. On an organic basis, consumable sales declined by 57.7% as compared to prior year. The decline in organic sales was due to lower demand in all three regions as dentists and customers reduced dental visits and procedures in response to COVID-19. Key drivers of this decline\u00a0 were lower sales of Endodontic, Restorative, and Preventive products.\u00a0Technologies & Equipment SegmentSecond quarter 2020 sales were $304 million, down 45.6% versus prior year. Currency reduced sales by 1.0%, while divestitures and discontinued products reduced sales growth by 1.0%. On an organic basis, net sales declined by 43.6%. Key drivers of the decrease in organic sales were Equipment & Instruments, Digital Dentistry, and Implants businesses.\u00a0Cash Flow and LiquidityOperating cash flow in the second quarter of 2020 was $175 million, up 20.7% as compared to operating cash flow generation of $145 million in the second quarter of 2019. The strong cash flow performance this quarter was driven by a reduction in working capital, primarily related to a decrease in accounts receivables and to a lesser extent, a reduction in inventory.In the second quarter, the Company paid $22 million in dividends, bringing a total of $184 million returned to shareholders in the first six months of 2020. At June 30, 2020, the Company had $1.1 billion of cash available on its balance sheet.Fiscal Year 2020 OutlookAs a result of the uncertainty around the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the business, the Company is not providing 2020 guidance.Expanding the Restructuring Plan \u2013 Path to Durable Value-CreationIn November 2018, the Board launched a comprehensive plan originally designed to achieve annualized topline growth of 3% to 4% on a consistent basis, and adjusted operating income margin of 22% by the end of 2022. The plan also includes evaluating non-core and underperforming businesses, utilizing free cash flow generation and excess balance sheet capacity to return cash to shareholders, and reviewing additional longer-term cost savings opportunities.As the Company continued to execute on its restructuring plan, additional opportunities have become apparent. Today, the Company announced that it is taking a number of additional steps, including two portfolio shaping initiatives and additional actions designed to simplify the organization and improve productivity.\u00a0Management now anticipates annual cost savings of approximately $250 million, up from the previous target range of $200 to $225 million. The Company has already incurred approximately $225 million of restructuring expense, and now expects to incur approximately $375 million in total one-time expenditures and charges, up from the previous estimate of $275 million. The additional portfolio shaping initiatives announced today include:  * The clear aligner market is an attractive opportunity for Dentsply Sirona, as it allows the\u00a0 Company to take full advantage of its unique strategic assets and its track record of innovation.\u00a0 The Company is exiting the traditional orthodontics business, which includes brackets, bands, tubes and wires. The Company is transferring a portion of its traditional orthodontic assets to support the ramp up of its clear aligner business, which is experiencing strong revenue growth. The traditional orthodontic business is a component of the Technologies & Equipment Segment. This business had net sales of approximately $132 million in 2019.\u00a0   \u00a0  * As the laboratory market evolves, the digital space is one that offers Dentsply Sirona an opportunity to innovate and take advantage of our digital assets. Accordingly, the Company is exiting a portion of the analog laboratory business that manufactures removable dentures and related products. This business is a component of the Consumables Segment and had net sales of approximately $44 million in 2019.The net income of the two businesses mentioned above is not material to the Company\u2019s consolidated results. Together, the portfolio shaping initiatives and additional actions are expected to result in the closure of several facilities and an incremental reduction of approximately 6% to 7% of the Company's workforce by the end of 2021. The ongoing execution of the restructuring will enhance Dentsply Sirona's continuing efforts to grow revenues, expand margins, and simplify the organization.Conference Call/Webcast Information  Dentsply Sirona\u2019s management team will host an investor conference call and live webcast on August 6, 2020 at 8:00 am ET.

S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) as well as other press releases or other public statements, contains or may contain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements about the Company\u2019s restructuring initiatives and their expected impact, and other plans, objectives, expectations (financial or otherwise) or intentions.The Company\u2019s forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested in any forward-looking statements. The Company does not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to such forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Any number of factors could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by any forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the risks associated with the following:  * the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak and the adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including, but not limited to, the Company's growth, operating costs, customer demand for products and industry demand generally, margins, and its ability to access capital markets, and the global economy and financial markets generally;      * the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak, and the current economic environment generally, on the Company's working capital, cash flows and liquidity;      * the Company's ability to execute key strategic activities due to competing priorities and strategies of its distribution partners and other factors      * the Company's ability to protect its technology infrastructure from cyber-attacks and other disruptions      * the Company's ability to maintain effective internal controls during periods of restructuring and organizational changes      * a significant failure or disruption in service within the Company\u2019s operations or the operations of key distributors      * the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain talented employees, or to manage succession and retention for its key executives      * the Company's ability to successfully implement its cost reduction and restructuring plans      * the Company's ability to regain profitability in a very competitive marketplace, which depends upon the Company's ability to differentiate its products and services from those of competitors      * results in pending and future litigation, investigations or other proceedings which could subject the Company to significant monetary damages or penalties and/or require it to change its business practices, or the costs incurred in connection with such proceedings      * other risks described from time to time in the Company\u2019s filings with the SECInvestors should carefully consider these and other relevant factors, including those risk factors in Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in the Company's most recent Form 10-K, in Part II, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in the Company's subsequent Form 10-Qs, and information which may be contained in the Company\u2019s other filings with the SEC, when reviewing any forward-looking statement. Investors should understand it is impossible to predict or identify all such factors or risks. As such, investors should not consider either the foregoing list, or the risks identified in the Company\u2019s SEC filings, to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties associated with an investment in the Company.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe Company defines \"organic sales\" as the increase or decrease in net sales excluding: (1) net sales from acquired and divested businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition or divestiture, (2) net sales attributable to discontinued product lines in both the current and prior year periods, and (3) the impact of foreign currency translation, which is calculated by comparing current-period sales to prior-period sales, with both periods converted to the U.S. dollar rate at local currency foreign exchange rates for each month of the prior period.The \"organic sales\" measure is not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"US GAAP\"); therefore, this item represents a Non-GAAP measure. This Non-GAAP measure may differ from those used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP. Organic sales is an important internal measure for the Company. The Company's senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes organic sales. The performance of the Company is measured on this metric along with other performance metrics.The Company discloses organic sales to allow investors to evaluate the performance of the Company\u2019s operations exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period and may not be indicative of past or future performance of the normal operations of the Company. The Company believes that this information is helpful in understanding underlying net sales trends.Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Per Diluted Common ShareIn addition to reporting net income (loss) attributable to Dentsply Sirona and earnings (loss) per diluted common share in accordance with US GAAP, the Company provides adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted common share (\u201cadjusted EPS\u201d) measures. The Company defines \"adjusted net income (loss)\" as net income (loss) attributable to Dentsply Sirona excluding certain items as noted below. Adjusted EPS is calculated by dividing adjusted net income (loss) by diluted common shares outstanding.The adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Dentsply Sirona consists of net income (loss) attributable to Dentsply Sirona adjusted to exclude the following:(1) Business combination related costs and fair value adjustments. These adjustments include costs related to integrating and consummating mergers and recently acquired businesses, as well as costs, gains and losses related to the disposal of businesses or significant product lines. In addition, this category includes the roll off to the consolidated statements of operations of fair value adjustments related to business combinations, except for amortization expense noted below. These items are irregular in timing and as such may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and are therefore excluded to allow investors to better understand underlying operating trends.(2) Restructuring program related costs and other costs. These adjustments include costs related to the implementation of restructuring initiatives as well as certain other costs. These costs can include, but are not limited to, severance costs, facility closure costs, lease and contract termination costs, related professional service costs, duplicate facility and labor costs associated with specific restructuring initiatives, as well as legal settlements and impairments of assets. These items are irregular in timing, amount and impact to the Company\u2019s financial performance. As such, these items may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and are therefore excluded for the purpose of understanding underlying operating trends.(3) Amortization of purchased intangible assets. This adjustment excludes the periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets. Amortization expense has been excluded from adjusted net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona to allow investors to evaluate and understand operating trends excluding these large non-cash charges.(4) Credit risk and fair value adjustments. These adjustments include both the cost and income impacts of adjustments in certain assets and liabilities including the Company\u2019s pension obligations, that are recorded through net income which are due solely to the changes in fair value and credit risk. These items can be variable and driven more by market conditions than the Company\u2019s operating performance. As such, these items may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and therefore are excluded for comparability purposes.(5) Income tax related adjustments. These adjustments include both income tax expenses and income tax benefits that are representative of income tax adjustments mostly related to prior periods, as well as the final settlement of income tax audits, and discrete tax items resulting from the implementation of restructuring initiatives and the vesting and exercise of employee share-based compensation. These adjustments are irregular in timing and amount and may significantly impact the Company\u2019s operating performance. As such, these items may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and therefore are excluded for comparability purposes.The \"adjusted net income (loss)\" and \"adjusted EPS\" measures are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States; therefore, these items represent Non-GAAP measures. These Non-GAAP measures may differ from those used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP. Income tax related adjustments may include the impact to adjust the interim effective income tax rate to the expected annual effective tax rate.Both adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted EPS are important internal measures for the Company. The Company's senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted EPS. The performance of the Company is measured on these metrics along with other performance metrics.The Company discloses adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted EPS to allow investors to evaluate the performance of the Company\u2019s operations exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period and may not be indicative of past or future performance of the normal operations of the Company and certain large non-cash charges related to intangible assets either purchased or acquired through a business combination. The Company believes that this information is helpful in understanding underlying operating trends and cash flow generation.Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) and MarginIn addition to reporting operating income (loss) in accordance with US GAAP, the Company provides adjusted operating income (loss) and margin. The Company defines \"adjusted operating income (loss)\" as operating income (loss) in accordance with US GAAP excluding certain items noted above which are excluded on a pre-tax basis to arrive at adjusted operating income (loss), a Non-GAAP measure. The adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income (loss) by net sales.The \"adjusted operating income (loss)\" and \"adjusted operating margin\" measures are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States; therefore, these items represent Non-GAAP measures. These Non-GAAP measures may differ from those used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP.Both adjusted operating income (loss) and adjusted operating margin are important internal measures for the Company.
