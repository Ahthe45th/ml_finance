The social networking giant is launching ads globally on the TikTok-clone, according to Reuters.\n\n\n\nThe move to run ads on the video platform follows trials in select markets, including India, Brazil, and Germany. During the trial phase, the company ran ads from brands such as Netflix (NFLX), Uber (UBER), and Louis Vuitton.\n\n\n\nIn support of the ads on Instagram Reels, CFO Justin Osofsky says the ads will provide a way to discover new content. (See Facebook stock chart on TipRanks).\n\n\n\nOsofsky said, \"Brands of all sizes can take advantage of this new creative format in an environment where people are already being entertained.\"\n\n\n\nReuters reports that ads on Reels will loop and will be up to 30 seconds long. The ads will also appear in between individual Reels. The ads should allow Facebook to make money by taking advantage of the growing consumption of short videos that present a unique advertising opportunity.\n\n\n\nThe unveiling of ads on Reels comes at a time when Facebook has consistently delivered strong results. According to HSBC analyst Nicolas Cote-Colisson, FB should continue to benefit from strong demand for online advertising. However, Cote-Colisson states that his \"regulatory barometer is showing no signs of significant cooling down.\"\n\n\n\nThe analyst recently reiterated a Sell rating on the stock but increased his price target to $275 from 220, implying 18.3% downside potential to current levels.\n\n\n\nConsensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 29 Buys, 4 Holds, and 1 Sell. The Facebook average analyst price target of $387.03 implies a 15.01% upside potential to current levels.\n\n\n\nFB scores a \u201cPerfect 10\u201d on TipRanks\u2019 Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated News:Spotify Unveils New Audio Interactive FeatureDish Collaborates with Dell for 5G Infrastructure RolloutBlackRock to Snap Up Baringa Partners\u2019 Climate Change Scenario Model", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ad06e9ceba2361df34f2c4954362a4f81d0097b6221a0bc38601b2148aa9ff38"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1623999669, "headline": "US STOCKS-Recovery bets keep S&P, Nasdaq futures near record highs", "id": 68352997, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2021-06-18T111129Z_1_OV4_RTRLXPP_2_LYNXPACKAGER.JPG?668403549", "related": "FB", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "Futures tracking the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq indexes hovered near record highs on Friday as optimism around a speedy economic recovery overshadowed the Federal Reserve's hawkish stance on monetary stimulus.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e8ca69c6db65b59384090e0410cdca0c38d20b27425d3995605189303a7a3fe5"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1623999600, "headline": "I Was Wrong About Facebook; Apple Can't Hurt It", "id": 68346615, "image": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/953528462/medium_image_953528462.jpg", "related": "FB", "source": "SeekingAlpha", "summary": "Facebook might have lost to Apple in maintaining cross-app tracking, but the company has ways of maintaining its competitive position regardless.
