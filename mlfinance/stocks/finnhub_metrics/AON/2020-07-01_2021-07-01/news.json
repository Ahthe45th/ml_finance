Shares of the global professional service company rallied as investors reacted to a 10% increase in revenue to $3.5 billion.Revenue growth was driven mainly by strong retention and net new business generation. Aon also benefited from a 5% reduction in its operating expenses. Net income attributable to shareholders increased 18% to $913 million, or $4 a share. Cash flow from operations was up 66% to $561 million, as free cash flow increased 91% to $532 million. During the quarter, Aon purchased 0.2 million Class A ordinary shares, valued at $50 million. (See Aon stock analysis on TipRanks)\u201cIn the first quarter, our colleagues delivered an outstanding operational performance including 6% organic revenue growth and 170 basis points of margin improvement, building on over a decade of progress on our key financial metrics, creating momentum for 2021, and demonstrating the power of Aon United,\" said CEO Greg Case.Impressed by strong organic growth numbers and earnings, Wells Fargo analyst Elyse Greenspan reiterated a Buy rating. According to the analyst, AON is well-positioned for mid-single-digit or greater revenue growth in 2021.\u201cAON is positioned to show a pick up in organic revenue growth as we move through 2021 and should continue to improve its margins. Overall, we view the WLTW acquisition favorably (expected to close in H1 2021) and believe the company's accretion guidance could prove to be conservative and especially expect them to exceed the $800 million of expense savings for the transaction,\u201d Greenspan wrote in a research note to investors.The analyst has a $287 price target on Aon, implying a 14.14% upside potential to current levels.The consensus among analysts on Wall Street is that AON is a Moderate Buy, based on 3 Buy, 3 Hold and 1 Sell ratings. The average analyst price target of $258.67 implies a 2.88% upside potential to current levels.AON scores a 6 out of 10 on TipRanks\u2019 Smart Score rating system, suggesting its performance is likely to align with market averages.\u00a0Related News:Comscore Secures Long-Term Renewal Agreement With BBC World NewsApple Slapped With $12M Fine In Russia Over Anti-Competitive Practices - ReportBaidu To Launch Autonomous Ride-Hailing Services In Beijing", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=cbf0bee92956786408af55f7d1ed0c790a20507475bf93119a0469ad6ed1a3d1"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620090215, "headline": "Aon plc Just Beat Revenue Estimates By 5.1%", "id": 67442495, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?979980207", "related": "AON", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "It's been a good week for Aon plc (NYSE:AON) shareholders, because the company has just released its latest first-quarter results, and the shares gained 10.0% to US$252.

Bullish 0 0 2 0 Indifferent 1 0 1 1 Somewhat Bearish 0 0 0 0 Bearish 0 0 0 0 In the last 3 months, 6 analysts have offered 12-month price targets for Aon.

How Are Analyst Ratings Determined? Ratings come from analysts, or specialists within banking and financial systems that report for specific stocks or defined sectors (typically once per quarter for each stock). Analysts usually derive their information from company conference calls and meetings, financial statements, and conversations with important insiders to reach their decisions. Analysts also give out recommendations like \"buy\", \"sell\", \"hold\", or similar verbage for each stock based on their overall evaluations of the corres ponding company. A \"buy\" indicates that an analyst is optimistic about a stock's short-term or mid-term growth, recommending traders to purchase the stock. Contrastingly, a \"sell\" means that an analyst believes the stock will trend downwards in that same time frame. A \"hold\" suggests that investors should not buy more of or sell any of the specified stock due to that analyst's prediction of stagnation. Some analysts also offer predictions for helpful metrics such as earnings, revenue, and growth estimates to provide further guidance as to what to do with certain tickers. It is important to keep in mind that while stock and sector analysts are specialists, they are also human and can only forecast their beliefs to traders.

offering a broad range of risk, retirement and health solutions, has extended its long-term partnership with parametric technology firm CelsiusPro. CelsiusPro is a Swiss-based insurance technology firm specializing in risk modeling, underwriting and administration of index-based insurance products in the context of weather risk and natural disasters.The collaboration between Aon (AON) and CelsiusPro has culminated in parametric data being delivered within a few hours of a triggering event, and the subsequent claim sometimes being paid within 48 hours.\u201cDue to the speed of the payout, parametric solutions offer clients immediate and quantifiable cashflow as opposed to the delayed cash replacement offered by traditional insurance,\u201d said Paul Ramiz, Director of Aon\u2019s Innovation and Solutions team.Aon and CelsiusPro have been working together since 2012, and their partnership has been key in the structuring of client solutions across multiple sectors all over the world, particularly in the risk analysis and design of hurricane insurance products.This development comes on the same day as EU antitrust regulators' announcement that they are investigating Aon\u2019s $30 billion bid for Willis Towers to create the world\u2019s largest insurance broker. Aon missed the deadline on Monday to provide concessions to address EU competition concerns, according to Reuters. (See AON stock analysis on TipRanks)Piper Sandler analyst Paul Newsome downgraded the stock a month ago to a Hold with a price target of $187.00 (9% downside potential). He stated, \u201cThe company has a high proportion of its businesses in economically sensitive consulting businesses with heavy project work components to revenue.\u201dConsensus among analysts is a Hold based on 1 Buy, 3 Holds and 1 Sell. The average price target of $216.75 implies a potential upside of around 6% over the next 12 months.Related News:Barclays Fined \u00a326M For \u2018Poor\u2019 Treatment Of Customers In Financial HardshipPTC To Snap Up Arena For $715M; Street Says BuyCoronavirus Weighs on H&M\u2019s Q4 Sales; Analysts Remain Cautious", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=18a809138f6e8d019556774ccc93a604b121198d22cda1fa1f1806725885810e"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1608015576, "headline": "EXCLUSIVE-Aon's $30 bln Willis Towers deal faces EU probe - sources", "id": 61748337, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2020-06-03T153156Z_504476917_RC2R1H9P0GOY_RTRMADP_2_HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-GLOBAL-OFFICE.JPG?234307771", "related": "AON", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "Aon's $30 billion bid for Willis Towers to create the world's largest insurance broker faces a full-scale investigation because of its complexity, two people familiar with the matter said.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=f534592c060d36a43416b1f02228d67d04c3c7eb859e671d90aa77c91bca9708"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1608013950, "headline": "EXCLUSIVE-EU to investigate $30 bln Aon, Willis Towers deal - sources", "id": 61748338, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2020-06-03T153156Z_504476917_RC2R1H9P0GOY_RTRMADP_2_HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-GLOBAL-OFFICE.JPG?1180964238", "related": "AON", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "EU antitrust regulators are set to open a full-scale investigation into Aon's $30 billion bid for Willis Towers to create the world's largest insurance broker, two people familiar with the matter said.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=87a63d2ae14bc32dc504aa8b45855c1e24cf97e4d9ece37dd85e92e74765cbc8"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1608001200, "headline": "Airlines warned over safety as jets return from pandemic storage", "id": 61742426, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2020-12-15T081248Z_1_EX1_RTRLXPP_2_LYNXPACKAGER.JPG?1301889983", "related": "AON", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "Regulators, insurers and experts are warning airlines to take extra care when reactivating planes left in extended storage during the COVID-19 pandemic, citing potential pilot rustiness, maintenance errors and even insect nests blocking key sensors.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a08cbe618d78851f6561501fcfb8105268c09cd6739d9e560ecc35d75c56e852"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1607968800, "headline": "Airlines warned over safety as jets return from pandemic storage", "id": 61741114, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2020-03-13T105219Z_566482351_RC2YIF9GYKL0_RTRMADP_2_HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-AIRLINES.JPG?1853051915", "related": "AON", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "Regulators, insurers and experts are warning airlines to take extra care when reactivating planes left in extended storage during the COVID-19 pandemic, citing potential pilot rustiness, maintenance errors and even insect nests blocking key sensors.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=bd20e02c61b147f395872b6b28627086351f2dc01664fb7e28461b06bd22e7a7"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1606719600, "headline": "U.S. insurers dig into corporate diversity practices as lawsuits pile up", "id": 61540313, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?747216471", "related": "AON", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "U.S. insurers are taking a closer look at the recruiting and succession practices of corporate customers, worried about mounting lawsuits over a lack of diversity among top executives and directors, industry sources said.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=06afe600fa900aa9d773d1cd3e3efa5ff71f04f9134932dcd34720880f3eb9bf"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1606215378, "headline": "IWF, DG, EW, AON: Large Outflows Detected at ETF", "id": 61479001, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?1411454695", "related": "AON", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "Looking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at ETF Channel, one standout is the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (Symbol: IWF) where we have detected an approximate $67.7 million dollar outflow -- that's a 0.1% decrease week over", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ad7dd3410cc2b5c22f1c77e970d8e17f1d9088ff6ec01f1eed3801df0903794d"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1605784984, "headline": "Interesting AON Put And Call Options For July 2021", "id": 61421304, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?1297332025", "related": "AON", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "Investors in Aon plc  (Symbol: AON) saw new options become available today, for the July 2021 expiration.

Much of what\u2019s left comes from things you can\u2019t see or count: algorithms and brands and lists.This is, in the broadest sense, a new phenomenon. Back in 1985, for instance, before Silicon Valley came to dominate the ranks of America\u2019s biggest companies, tangible assets tended to be closer to half the market\u2019s value.The shift picked up after the financial crisis of 2008 and is taking off anew during the Covid-19 lockdown, with the value of intangible-heavy companies like Google and Facebook soaring while smokestack stocks languish. All of which is a source of deep concern for those who worry about things like employment and inequality.The rise of intangibles helps explain why many American workers have recently had it so rough, with wages stagnating and benefits disappearing, and signals the slide could continue, according to the New York University professor whose writings have ignited a debate on the topic in academia, Baruch Lev.In the abstract, it\u2019s behind the backlash against giant tech firms that found its way into Congress. Put simply, these assets don\u2019t require the hordes of workers to create and maintain them the way old economy ones did.So for all the hand-wringing and fretting about how the pandemic run-up in tech stocks bespeaks a bubble that\u2019s bound to burst, what if the bigger concern is that it doesn\u2019t?\u201cWhen people think about this growing income inequality, much of it comes from the growing inequality in the corporate sector,\u201d says Lev, the director of accounting research at NYU\u2019s business school. \u201cThose that are successful are enormously successful. And the others that still employ lots of people really cannot get out of this trap.\u201dAt one level, this is all perfectly rational. Stock investors are just anticipating, and putting claims on, these companies\u2019 ability to generate revenue streams for years to come. Industrial innovation has been framed as anti-human since its earliest days, often wrongly. Even the terms are squishy -- assigning market value to the tangible and intangible property is in many respects a judgment call.Still, researchers including Lev are stepping up warnings, concerned about the influence of Covid-19 on the economy and equality.By way of illustration, consider a company like Adobe Inc., whose programs altered the printing industry. So valuable are its formulas and algorithms that even with a market cap of $237 billion, the value of its hard, tangible assets comes out to virtually nothing. Adobe employs more than 22,000 people, by any measure a lot, but it\u2019s part of a technological wave that by some yardsticks cut employment in printing by half. (An Adobe spokesperson declined to comment.)If you work at a company riding this wave or better yet own one, you\u2019re doing well. Adobe shares are up 50% this year, part of a surge in tech shares that has added $2 trillion to their combined market cap even as a recession raged. For everyone else, the news is less good. One loose way of thinking of the impact is that while intellectual property tends to create a small set of well-to-do workers, it often displaces a larger set of hourly ones.\u201cAs we\u2019ve all had to move into a digital world, it makes sense that a lot of the investments are in a digital world, which are intangible,\u201d said Megan Greene, senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School. \u201cIt comes at the expense of the worker, though. This crisis has accelerated a lot of things, and that\u2019s one of them.\u201dWhile even experts differ on what constitutes an intangible asset, and some view Lev\u2019s definitions as loose, expansion in the value of things like Facebook Inc.\u2019s advertising platform, Netflix Inc.\u2019s customer algorithms and Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s user networks is attracting attention now if for no other reason than it explains a mystery of the pandemic era: the stock market\u2019s uncanny resilience.Whenever someone points out that six or seven gigantic tech stocks dominate the S&P 500 like never before, they\u2019re partly describing the rising dominance of invisible assets. Rallies in companies like Facebook and Alphabet Inc. are a key way the value of intellectual property has expanded.As a result of those gains, S&P 500 members held more than $21 trillion in intangibles at the end of 2018, more than double 2005, according to a report by research center Ponemon Institute and Aon Plc, a professional services firm that provides risk and insurance consulting. That\u2019s 84% of the S&P 500\u2019s market value, the most ever.To be sure, not everyone buys those numbers, which treat anything that isn\u2019t directly ascribable to a tangible asset in the S&P 500\u2019s market value as intangible. \u201cI got a Ph.D in finance, not accounting, but I would say I\u2019m not sure if I agree,\u201d said Linda Zhang, CEO and founder of Purview Investments and senior adviser to Social Finance Inc. \u201cMarket cap is an indication of willingness to pay for future earnings. Part of that difference could reflect how much both tangible and intangible assets can generate in earnings in the future. I don\u2019t think the difference is just intangible.\u201dEven so, the market has never traded at such premiums to its hard assets. Data compiled by Bloomberg show the S&P 500 sits at more than 12 times its tangible book value, a record multiple.While premiums on invisible assets have risen before, particularly in the dot-com bubble, this trend is bigger and more entrenched, given the enormous earnings that intellectual property now generate. Like most things in the economy, it\u2019s being amplified by Covid-19, which divides have and have-nots according to who can work from home. The rich are getting richer in markets, too: as shares rebounded, valuations for the most expensive firms rose three times faster than the rest, Bloomberg Intelligence data show.In the economy, that signal -- the market\u2019s appetite for earnings based not on plants and machinery but ideas -- feeds itself. The share of business investment targeted at invisible assets is right now rising 1 1/2-times faster than it did during the financial crisis, itself a record period of hyper-investment in intangibles, estimates Jason Thomas, the head of global research at Carlyle Group.\u201cSuch spending tends to be motivated by a desire to do more with less,\u201d Thomas wrote in a report last month. \u201cPast increases in the intangible share of corporate outlays have been associated with slower recoveries in employment.\u201dIt\u2019s a bleak projection for a labor market still reeling from the shutdowns, with close to 8% of people in the U.S. unemployed. Companies including Walt Disney Co. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc recently announced thousands of layoffs. Nearly 70,000 jobs have been cut across the banking industry this year.According to Vincent Deluard, director of global macro strategy at brokerage StoneX Group Inc., this transformation is inherently unequal because it weights rewards to companies that by definition require fewer people. Back in the 19th century, capitalism required large physical investments, such as canals, dams and railroads, which in turn created jobs. That\u2019s true to a much smaller extent now.\u201cInvestments in intangible assets do not create many jobs. Think of the payment processing platforms versus the banks -- owning the network is always better than owning the physical branches. Think about social media versus newspaper -- owning the platform is much better than generating it,\u201d Deluard said. \u201cIt is a huge secular transformation creating winners and losers everywhere.\u201dEconomic recoveries that focus more on intangible investments have increasingly been met with slower labor market bounce-backs. In the early 1980s, it took fewer than 30 months until employment levels returned to their prior peak, as spending on intangible investments rose 3.4%. Emerging from the dot-com bust, it took nearly 50 months. The labor market recovery after the financial crisis took about 70 months to return to prior levels as intangible investment spending rose a record 7.5%, Carlyle data show.One of the main ways intangibles sap employment and other growth measures is their scalability, according to NYU\u2019s Lev. A product whose value is derived entirely from a formula, like a drug or software, can be sold millions of times with minimal additional investment.\u201cBut if you think about tangible assets, physical assets, they are not scalable,\u201d Lev said. \u201cYou can use a seat in an airplane only once or twice a day. You cannot sell the same seat 5,000 times a day.\u201dThere\u2019s little doubt which model the stock market prefers this year. Investors have been falling over themselves to reward businesses that deemphasize humans. At a time people are kept at home and companies with fewer digital capabilities have struggled, firms that rely least on their employees compared with intangible assets have beaten labor-intensive ones by 37 percentage points in 2020, according to an analysis by Deluard.The result has been already-giant companies in some cases doubling in size. The Nasdaq 100 is up 34% this year, compared with a 3% decline for the small-cap Russell 2000 gauge, and has almost doubled in less than two years. There\u2019s a clear correlation between investment in intangible assets and market capitalization, according to the Aon report.Dominance by idea-based companies boiled over in 2018 when for the first time the five biggest companies derived a majority of their value from intangibles, using Aon\u2019s definitions: Apple, Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com, Alphabet and Facebook. They\u2019ve done nothing but get bigger since, grabbing market share in the lockdown and pushing their weighting to a record 23% of the S&P 500 and close to half of the Nasdaq 100.Compare that with 1985, when the five largest were IBM Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp., General Electric Co., Schlumberger N.V. and Chevron Corp -- massive firms with plenty of tangible assets.According to NYU\u2019s Lev, estimates of intangible asset value are somewhat nebulous considering no one can possibly predict the future. For example, the value of Apple\u2019s patents depend somewhat on China\u2019s continued willingness to allow the iPhone maker to sell freely in its market. Still, he estimates roughly 75% of S&P 500 value stems from intangible assets when taking into account fluctuations.The value of Moderna Inc.\u2019s intangible assets heavily rely on the biotech firm\u2019s ability to develop and distribute a coronavirus vaccine. Consider the math: Moderna\u2019s market-cap amounts to about $28 billion, yet the company\u2019s tangible book value (what can be found on its balance sheet) is less than $1.2 billion. That means $26.9 billion -- or 96% -- of Moderna\u2019s market value is derived from intangibles. Shares of Moderna have soared 265% this year.Could it be a fad? To be sure, when some people hear \u201cintangible asset growth\u201d as a reason to justify stock surges and high valuations, they\u2019re reminded of the dot-com bubble. Back in 1999, eyeballs and site visit numbers were inputs for premising investment, a strategy that ended in one of the greatest busts ever.\u201cYou have to peg valuation to something and I always get nervous when the discussion changes from earnings, revenue, margins -- whatever you want to use as your metric,\u201d said Paul Nolte, a portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management. \u201cNow we\u2019re changing that metric to something else because of the situation that we\u2019re in, and all that\u2019s doing is justifying the high price. To me that becomes more bubble-like.\u201dBut Nolte acknowledges there\u2019s a key difference between now and then -- that the darling megacap companies of today generate billions of dollars in profits. To some investors, there\u2019s no obvious reason their preeminence should change.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how being long intangibles, short human beings has been such a winning trade -- not just this year, but for quite a while,\u201d said Jared Woodard, the head of the Research Investment Committee at Bank of America. \u201cRight now we have an economy structured to reward these asset-light business models.\u201dFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=85fae8d9b2f25d209b6d830614bd54fe9ddccc7b5a59e754e2f5563f990d25ca"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1603260000, "headline": "FOCUS-U.S. retailers secure stores as worries about election unrest mount", "id": 61149550, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2020-10-20T202111Z_736598775_RC2KMJ9SDK0O_RTRMADP_2_USA-ELECTION-RETAIL-SECURITY.JPG?1723583817", "related": "AON", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "This time last year, shoppers on Chicago's Magnificent Mile were waiting for Louis Vuitton to debut its whimsical holiday window decorations.
