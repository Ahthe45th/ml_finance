(See CarMax stock chart on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nFor the first quarter, net earnings stood at $2.63 per share, up from $0.03 year over year, and surpassed the Street's estimate of $1.63 per share.\n\n\n\nNet sales climbed 138.4% to $7.70 billion, beating the analysts' estimate of $6.24 billion.\n\n\n\nRetail used car sales doubled to 270,799 cars, and Wholesale used car sales grew 186.6% to 181,389 compared to the year-ago period. Retail comparable store sales increased 99.1% year-over-year.\n\n\n\nBill Nash the company\u2019s President and CEO said, \u201cWith the most customer-centric experience in our industry, a highly profitable operating and financial model, and significant opportunities to grow our existing businesses and expand across the broader used auto ecosystem, we remain confident in our ability to meet our long-term targets of revenue growth, total unit growth, and market share.\"\n\n\n\nBy fiscal 2026, CarMax targets $33 billion in revenue and 2 million units in sales per year through its Retail and Wholesale channels combined.

It's an interesting time for autos, Murphy told CNBC co-host Andrew Sorkin: production has been restrained due to supply shortages and demand has recovered. Murphy's Autos Forecast: Sorkin asked the analyst what company will be the winner in the space five years from now \"You are going to see a lot of the incumbents do really well,\" Murphy said, putting General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) at the top of the list. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) will continue to raise capital and invest for the future, he said. \"I think you will see some of the new entrants do pretty well also.\" The Fate Of Used Cars: The industry will need to transition at some point, as internal combustion engines become the past and EVs move from the future into the present, Murphy told CNBC. In terms of used cars, the industry is being professionalized with companies like Carvana Co. (NYSE: CVNA) and CarMax Inc (NYSE: KMX), the analyst said, adding that this makes consumers more comfortable buying used vehicles. Murphy said he expects these companies to persist well into the EV future, which will be \"good for the industry.\" 2021 Price Action: General Motors is up 48.75% year-to-date. Tesla is down 1.99% year-to-date. Carvana is up 15.89% year-to-date. CarMax is up 33.74% year-to-date. Image by Sravan Kumar Anirudhan from Pixabay.

CarMax\u2019s (KMX) 4Q earnings dipped 2.3% to $1.27 per share compared to $1.30 reported in the prior-year period but beat analysts\u2019 expectations of $1.26. Net sales and operating revenues of $5.16 billion missed the Street\u2019s estimates of $5.17 billion but advanced 4.1% from the year-ago period. The company\u2019s total used unit sales and unit sales in comparable stores declined 0.9% and 2.3%, respectively, while wholesale units dropped 1.2% year-over-year. Sales were impacted by the delay in tax refunds and severe weather. (See CarMax stock analysis on TipRanks) Additionally, CarMax inked a cash-and-stock deal to acquire Edmunds, an online guide for car shoppers from research to purchase, for an enterprise value of $404 million. In Jan. 2020, CarMax acquired a minority stake in Edmunds by investing $50 million. The company will acquire the remaining shares of Edmunds and the purchase price includes CarMax\u2019s initial investment. CarMax expects the addition of Edmunds\u2019 net income to be immaterial to the company\u2019s earnings in fiscal 2022. CarMax CEO Bill Nash said, \u201cOur partnership to date has proven to be an outstanding combination as we\u2019ve developed innovative products, including an online instant appraisal offer on both edmunds.com and carmax.com. We look forward to collaborating on new products and initiatives leveraging Edmunds\u2019 industry-leading content and technology expertise to serve both CarMax and Edmunds\u2019 customers.\u201d Following the 4Q results, Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $130. Nagel said, \u201cOverall, we look upon underlying trends at KMX and commentary from management as decidedly constructive. We see today\u2019s modest pullback in KMX shares as reactive in nature and as making for a buying opportunity.\u201d CarMax shares have exploded 145.6% over the past year, while the stock still scores a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 4 Buys versus 1 Hold. That\u2019s alongside an average analyst price target of $135 which implies 9.5% upside potential from current levels. Furthermore, TipRanks\u2019 Stock Investors tool shows that investors currently have a Very Positive stance on CarMax, with 3.1% of investors increasing their exposure to KMX stock over the past 30 days.
