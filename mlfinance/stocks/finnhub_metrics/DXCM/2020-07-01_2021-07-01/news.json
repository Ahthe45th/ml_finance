Naturally, the bullishness extended to high-profitability potential growth investments like Senseonics (NYSEAMERICAN:SENS). As a play on the science, Senseonics is brilliant. As a portfolio booster, SENS stock might be a disaster. Source: Shutterstock About the only thing that could change the last sentence is if you were short the medical technology firm. To be clear, I\u2019m not recommending you short Senseonics shares, since that brings up another level of variability and risk. However, I am asking you to consider \u2014 as an idea, not advice \u2014 to sell SENS stock. Perhaps not all of it, but take some profits off the table while you still can. Before I get deluged with hate mail, let\u2019s go over why the idea of dumping SENS stock arouses intense anger. Fundamentally, I can understand the argument that Sensenoics is a game changer for diabetes patients. In the old paradigm, patients had to endure frequent and often painful finger pricks to monitor their blood-sugar levels. On the other hand, Senseonics provides freedom through its long-term continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips You can read the literature yourself, but to provide a very quick summary, medical professionals insert a sensor underneath the patient\u2019s skin. This enables frequent, accurate monitoring of blood-sugar levels for 90 days (via the Eversense 90-Day CGM System), doing away with finger pricks entirely. Further, as our own Mark Hake predicted recently, \u201cMy thesis is that SENS stock will recover once the FDA allows Senseonics to start selling its device in the U.S.\u201d Further, Hake mentions that Senseonics can follow in the footsteps of another CGM company, DexCom (NASDAQ:DXCM). 10 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks for Your Reliability Short List It\u2019s possible. Is it probable? The market doesn\u2019t agree. SENS Stock Is a High-Risk, Low-Probability Trade You might recall that a week or so ago, one of the biggest headlines was that debris from a Chinese rocket might land somewhere on populated parts of earth. Worse yet, experts didn\u2019t know exactly where the debris would land until hours before impact. Amid the cacophony, I appreciated one scientist\u2019s voice of reason. The world is about 70% water, so the chances of the debris landing on people are minimal. In other words, you have bigger problems to worry about. And that expert was right. Sure, the debris killing people made for great headlines. After all, if it bleeds, it leads. But sometimes, you must push away sensationalism and simply run the numbers. That\u2019s really the thesis for SENS stock that matters. For instance, medical equipment giant Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has a CGM called FreeStyle Libre. I\u2019m not sure if this CGM is better than Senseonics\u2019 CGM. But you know what? It doesn\u2019t matter. The market wants ABT, not SENS stock. Look at the variance in the shares available on Abbott\u2019s bid-ask spread. At time of writing, 10% more shares are available at the bid of $118.53 than the ask of $118.51. Put simply, more buyers exist than sellers, which suggests (though not guarantees) that ABT will move higher. My InvestorPlace colleague mentioned DexCom. Here, the situation is way starker, with nearly 38% more shares available at a $334.41 bid than an ask of $334.78. It implies again that DXCM will move higher. Unfortunately, Senseonics is a completely different story. In this case, nearly 36% more shares are available at a $1.91 ask than at a $1.90 bid. Stated another way, it\u2019s the opposite of the current housing market: Way more people want to sell than want to buy. The Math, Not the Feels Naturally, the guttural reaction to the above is that people who are selling SENS stock are idiots. Further, I\u2019m an idiot. Nevertheless, my idiocy has no bearing on free market dynamics. In fact, I could write the most beautifully crafted bullish (or bearish) argument for SENS stock. Folks, it\u2019s not going to change the wide discrepancy in the shares offered on the bid-ask spread. Definitely, it won\u2019t change a discrepancy like this. But this is a lesson on proper investing strategies, if you want to hear it. Idiots or not, the market is dumping SENS stock \u2014 and they want to dump some more! If you feel that\u2019s a bullish case for Senseonics, you\u2019re taking a huge risk. For me, I\u2019m staying away with 10-foot pole.

One such disorder is diabetes, which is growing rapidly worldwide\u2014sedentary lifestyles being a key reason for that. A recent report by the World Health Organization (WHO) revealed that deaths from diabetes surged 70% globally between 2019 and 2020.Abbott and Dexcom are some of the names that are developing diabetes monitoring systems. Using the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, we will place Abbott and Dexcom alongside each other and pick the stock reflecting a more compelling play.Abbott Laboratories (ABT)Abbott has a diversified business that includes four segments: Medical Devices, Diagnostics, Nutrition and Established Pharmaceutical Products (which generates revenue from the sale of branded generic pharmaceutical products outside of the US).Since the pandemic's onset, Abbott has been in the news for the multiple COVID-19 tests developed by the company. Most recently, BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Test Card was granted the FDA\u2019s emergency use authorization for virtually guided at-home use.Coming to diabetes, Abbott sees tremendous growth in the area, especially through its FreeStyle Libre technology, which is a sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring system. Sales of FreeStyle Libre systems grew 37.9% in 3Q 2020. \u00a0Moreover, in 3Q 2020, the company\u2019s FreeStyle Libre 3 system secured CE Mark for use by diabetic patients in Europe. The FreeStyle Libre 3 provides real-time glucose readings automatically delivered to the user\u2019s smartphone every minute, offering unsurpassed 14-day accuracy and real-time glucose alarms. The company also won CE Mark for its Libre Sense Glucose Sport Biosensor, which helps athletes \u201cbetter understand the efficacy of their nutritional choices on training and athletic performance.\u201dFurthermore, Abbott\u2019s FreeStyle Libre 2 received approval in December 2020 by Health Canada for adults and children (4 and older) with diabetes. (See ABT stock analysis on TipRanks)Last month, Raymond James analyst Jayson Bedford reiterated a Buy rating for Abbott following a call with the company\u2019s management. Bedford stated that the company is working through the reimbursement channels in Europe and expects to launch Libre 3 in the \u201ccoming months,\u201d while the analyst had anticipated a December launch.Bedford also specified that management did not lay out a timeline for Libre 3 roll out in the US, but he estimates the launch could happen in 2021. The analyst also noted that the app for the Libre 2 system has not yet been approved, but management is optimistic about the submission.Commenting on the prospects of the COVID-19 testing portfolio, Abbott\u2019s management anticipates the testing market to remain strong into mid-2021 and then start to decline in the second half of this year.To back his bullish stance on Abbott, the analyst concluded, \u201cThe 'third wave' of CV-19 has raised the near-term uncertainty level (for the group), but ABT remains well positioned given its diversified portfolio, and the CV-19 testing tailwind, which lessens the near-term risk profile. Management is executing well, and enters 2021 with momentum.\u201dOverall, consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 8 Buys versus 2 Holds. Abbott shares have risen 25.1% over the past year and the average price target of $120.57 suggests upside potential of 8.3% in the months ahead. \u00a0\u00a0Dexcom (DXCM)Diabetes is growing rapidly and so is the need for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, which Dexcom specializes in. The company's G6 CGM system is FDA-permitted for use by people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Last week, the company announced better-than-anticipated preliminary results for 4Q 2020, which calls for revenue to meet or exceed $567 million. This implies year-over-year growth of 23%, with U.S. revenue expected to rise about 20% to $451 million and international revenue to grow about 33% to $116 million. (See DXCM stock analysis on TipRanks)Overall, the company expects to meet or exceed revenue of $1.925 billion in 2020, reflecting a gain of over 30%. As for the initial 2021 outlook, Dexcom calls for top-line growth in the range of 15%-20%. The company\u2019s outlook is based on an increase in its sensor volumes, driven by the growing CGM awareness for people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, continued expansion beyond the US, shifting channel mix and overall market dynamics.Covering Dexcom for Oppenheimer, analyst Steven Lichtman notes that the company\u2019s international business was the primary driver of the revenue beat, owing to new initiatives including direct-to-consumer and e-commerce channel.Indeed, Dexcom is pursuing international growth and has extended its G6 CGM offering to additional markets, including the rollout in Belgium and Turkey in 4Q 2020.Commenting on the 2021 outlook, Lichtman noted that the company has maintained a conservative stance when it comes to its guidance in the past two years. The analyst assumes that the impact of competition from Abbott's Libre franchise is factored into the forecast. He believes that growth drivers for 2021 include \u201cbig new opportunities in T2 [Type 2 diabetes] and international expansion along with the G7 launch.\u201dOn the 3Q earnings call, Dexcom stated that it expects to launch G7 in several key markets in the second half of 2021, and then expand its reach into all of its core markets in 2022.Overall, Lichtman continues to be bullish on Dexcom and maintained a Buy rating with a $445 price target.Currently, Dexcom scores a Strong Buy analyst consensus based on 9 Buys and 2 Holds. The average price target stands at $456.11, indicating upside potential of 28.8% from current levels. Shares have already risen 53.5% over the past 52 weeks.Bottom lineAbbott\u2019s diversified business model and exposure to major growth areas like diabetes are its key strengths. Dexcom is completely focused on meeting the growing need for its CGM systems in the domestic as well as international markets. While the Street is bullish on both companies, right now, the average price target indicates a higher upside potential for Dexcom stock.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks\u2019\u00a0Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks\u2019 equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

The recent positive developments regarding two COVID-19 vaccine candidates has been a drag on the work-from-home stocks but bodes well for many sectors that were crushed due to lower demand amid shelter-at-home mandates. Several medical device makers will likely gain from the success of COVID-19 vaccines as these companies have been seeing weak demand, as the world\u2019s attention shifted from elective and other medical procedures to the unprecedented health crisis.Amid rising hopes of a recovery, we will use the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool to stack up Medtronic against Dexcom and see which medical devices company offers a better investment opportunity. \u00a0Medtronic (MDT)Leading medical device maker Medtronic boasts the Street\u2019s support as several analysts are optimistic about its long-term growth prospects despite the pandemic weighing down sales in recent quarters.  The company has an impressive product pipeline and has won over 180 regulatory approvals in the US, Europe, Japan and China this year. These approvals include devices to treat cardiac complications, chronic pain, urinary incontinence, brain-related disorders and diabetes.Medtronic is supplementing its organic growth with tuck-in acquisitions to strengthen its position in several areas like robotics. Its recent acquisitions include Ai Biomed to expand the ENT portfolio, Medicrea International and Digital Surgery to bolster the robotics portfolio and Avenu Medical to enhance its endovascular solutions. (See MDT stock analysis on TipRanks)The company is also addressing its weakness in lucrative areas like diabetes. Its recently launched MiniMed 780G insulin pump is receiving a favorable response in Europe. Medtronic also commenced the limited release of the 770G insulin pump in the US in November. In September, the company acquired Companion Medical, the maker of InPen\u2014a smart insulin pen system paired with an integrated diabetes management app.Meanwhile, last week, Medtronic reported its 2Q FY21 (ended Oct. 30) results and stated that it was seeing \u201ca faster-than-expected recovery and approaching year-over-year growth.\u201d The company fared better-than-expected but 2Q organic revenue was still down 1.5% and adjusted EPS fell 22%.\u00a0\u00a0Following the 2Q conference call, BTIG analyst Ryan Zimmerman increased the price target on Medtronic to $124 from $119 and reiterated a Buy rating. Zimmerman noted, \u201cNear-term commentary on procedural trends was encouraging with weekly sales in November improving over October as mgmt. signaled that pre-earnings FY3Q21 Consensus estimates for MDT's top-line were below guidance (-1% vs. flat to up slightly in FY3Q21).\u201d\u201cFurther, with mgmt. seeing no change to its expectations for FY4Q21, which assumes a normalization to sales, investors are likely assured that MDT should continue on its trajectory for the entire 2H of FY21. It seems that most investor focus though is looking past FY2H21 and onto FY22. As procedural dynamics stabilize and forthcoming pipeline products take hold, we believe the investments made in FY21 (which limited adj. OMs [operating margins]) should provide increased leverage through the P&L allowing adj. OM's to get back to pre-COVID levels (~29%),\u201d added the analyst.Overall, a Strong Buy analyst consensus on Medtronic is backed by 17 Buys versus 3 Holds and 1 Sell. Shares are currently trading at the start of the year levels. The average price target of $125.90 reflects an upside potential of 10.7% in the months ahead.Dexcom (DXCM)Dexcom produces continuous glucose monitoring (or CGM) systems, which help diabetes patients track their blood glucose levels continually, unlike the traditional monitoring devices that reflect blood glucose levels at a particular point in time. While other medical device companies suffered over recent quarters due to COVID-led slowdowns, Dexcom delivered better-than-anticipated results thanks to higher sales of disposable sensors for its CGM systems.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Despite strong volumes and new patient additions, Dexcom investors are concerned about pricing headwinds and rising competition. In October, shares took a hit when Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen downgraded the stock to Sell from Hold and slashed the price target to $350 from $420. Biegelsen feels that the recent approval of Abbott's Libre 3 in Europe will put downward pressure on Dexcom's pricing at a faster rate than anticipated by the Street as Libre 3 further closes the gap between the two companies' CGM technology.The analyst points out that Dexcom's G6 CGM is currently priced at a 134% premium to Abbott\u2019s Libre. He believes that with the growing adoption of the CGM category, customers around the world will become increasingly price-sensitive, thus putting pressure on Dexcom. (See DXCM stock analysis on TipRanks)Meanwhile, Dexcom is positive about the demand for its products and recently raised its forecast to reflect full-year revenue growth of 29%. It is also gearing up to launch the G7 device (currently in clinical trials) in several key markets during the second half of 2021. Dexcom sees tremendous international growth opportunities as diabetes is rising at an alarming rate. It has ramped up its manufacturing capacity to extend the G6 CGM offering to additional international markets, including recent launches in Belgium and Turkey.Currently, the Street\u2019s cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy analyst consensus for Dexcom is based on 8 Buys, 3 Holds and 1 Sell. Shares have gained 46.1% year-to-date and the average price target of $449.60 suggests further upside potential of 40.6% from current levels. \u00a0ConclusionMedtronic is surely an attractive long-term play with a diverse product portfolio that focuses on 70 health conditions. Also, it pays a quarterly dividend of $0.57 and has a dividend yield of 2.05%. That said, Dexcom\u2019s strong prospects in the diabetes market and the stock\u2019s significant upside potential compared to Medtronic make it a more favorable pick currently, though its high valuation could be a deterrent for some investors.\u00a0To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks\u2019\u00a0Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks\u2019 equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.
