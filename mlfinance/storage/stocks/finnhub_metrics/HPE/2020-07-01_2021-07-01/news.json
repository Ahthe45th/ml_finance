The terms of the deal have not yet been disclosed. Following the news, shares of the company gained 1.94% in Monday\u2019s trading session and closed at $14.73.\n\n\n\nWith Determined AI\u2019s expertise in machine learning training platforms and Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s leading AI and high-performance computing products, the acquisition is likely to lead to a greater quantum of accurate data insights into Hewlett Packard\u2019s customers.\n\n\n\nGeneral Manager of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Justin Hotard, said, \"Determined AI\u2019s unique open-source platform allows ML engineers to build models faster and deliver business value sooner without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. I am pleased to welcome the Determined AI team, which shares our vision to make AI more accessible to our customers and users, into the HPE family.\u201d (See\u00a0Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock chart\u00a0on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nOn June 2, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Matthew Sheerin reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $20 (35.8% upside potential).\n\n\n\nAccording to Sheerin, the company\u2019s stronger-than-expected April quarter results are a positive sign. However, muted growth guidance in the third quarter of the fiscal year could be cause for concern.  \n\n\n\nConsensus among analysts is a Hold based on 5 Buy, 7 Holds, and 2 Sells. The\u00a0average Hewlett Packard Enterprise analyst price target of $16.71 implies upside potential of 13.4% from current levels.

They\u2019re buying a 55.31% stake from Blackstone Capital Partners VI fund.That agreement triggered an open offer for an additional 26% stake in the Indian firm at 1,677.16 rupees apiece, which amounts to as much as 82.6 billion rupees ($1.1 billion). The offer price is a 1.1% discount to the closing share price on Friday. The stock gained as much as 6.5% in Mumbai after the offer.Blackstone\u2019s move to increase its stake in Mphasis is in sync with the U.S. asset manager\u2019s plans to boost investment in the South Asian nation. India is the strongest performer in the world for Blackstone and the firm intends to continue deploying large investments in the nation, Blackstone Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Stephen Schwarzman said during his visit to Mumbai in 2020.\u201cThis investment enables us to continue creating value for the long term and provide additional resources to further accelerate the company\u2019s growth momentum,\u201d Amit Dixit, head of India for Blackstone private equity, said in the statement. Mphasis specializes in providing cloud and digital solutions and serves 35 of the top 50 U.S. banking, financial services and insurance firms, according to the statement.Following the completion of the transactions, Blackstone is aiming to build MPhasis into a company worth $10 billion over the next four years, more than double its current valuation of about $4.4 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing internal targets. A representative for Blackstone declined to comment.Blackstone had purchased a majority stake in Mphasis in 2016 from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., paying 430 rupees per share at the time.(Updates with details about Blackstone\u2019s plans for Mphasis in sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=1758b218234dc389f941c7bb3be8c7b0063502c49e4b3bc71266eb4fbc524293"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619430506, "headline": "Blackstone offers to buy additional stake in India's Mphasis for $1.11 billion", "id": 66407865, "image": "https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20210426&t=2&i=1559921946&r=LYNXMPEH3P0GQ", "related": "HPE", "source": "Reuters", "summary": "Private equity firm Blackstone Group Inc on Monday offered 82.62 billion rupees ($1.11 billion) to buy an additional 26% stake in Indian IT outsourcing services provider Mphasis Ltd.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a298a74309a0ac66ccc4b2eac3b2cbb37a98027f07201c120d6dec9954afdc4d"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619423109, "headline": "Blackstone offers to buy additional stake in India's Mphasis for $1.1 billion", "id": 66343789, "image": "", "related": "HPE", "source": "Reuters", "summary": "Private equity firm Blackstone Group Inc on Monday offered 82.62 billion rupees to buy an additional 26% stake in Indian IT outsourcing services provider Mphasis Ltd.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=8528a6df2a06f5f12ff6c5cca82e406fc5b74918c66faa14cf259d42a60545ce"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619408472, "headline": "Blackstone offers to buy additional stake in India's Mphasis for $1.1 bln", "id": 66347425, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2021-04-26T051011Z_1_NB4_RTRLXPP_2_LYNXPACKAGER.JPG?1865713052", "related": "HPE", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "Private equity firm Blackstone Group Inc on Monday offered 82.62 billion rupees to buy an additional 26% stake in Indian IT outsourcing services provider Mphasis Ltd.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=dd223008ad7b7d04f989d9aa4f3dddddd2801d1bf3a69e4c9200814a233a4b00"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619399158, "headline": "Blackstone offers to buy additional stake in India's Mphasis for $1.1 billion", "id": 66347427, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2021-04-26T050920Z_1_KR3_RTRLXPP_2_LYNXPACKAGER.JPG?40927164", "related": "HPE", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "Private equity firm Blackstone Group has made an offer to acquire an additional 26% stake in Indian IT outsourcing services provider Mphasis Ltd for 82.62 billion rupees ($1.10 billion), a stock exchange filing showed on Monday.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b0767c33da7cd5f03ec4b572a643f7fedcbb00ca7996ec122676d6eaa1fb743a"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619343000, "headline": "HP Inc.: Backing Off After Recent Rally", "id": 66249593, "image": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/987512596/medium_image_987512596.jpg", "related": "HPE", "source": "SeekingAlpha", "summary": "HP Inc.
