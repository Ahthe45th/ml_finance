The company also increased its quarterly cash dividend.\n\n\n\nFollowing the earnings results, the share price jumped 3.3% to close at $139.85 on June 24.\n\n\n\nDarden reported total sales of $2.28 billion, which grew 79.5% from the year-ago period and beat revenue expectations of $2.12 billion.\n\n\n\nConsolidated same-restaurant sales grew 90.4% year-over-year.\n\n\n\nAdjusted earnings came in at $2.03 per share, beating consensus estimates of $1.68 per share. A loss of $1.24 per share was reported in the same quarter last year.\n\n\n\nDarden CEO Gene Lee said, \"Given the business transformation work we have done, and the demand we are seeing from the consumer, we are well positioned to thrive in this operating environment.\" (See Darden stock chart on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the company announced a quarterly cash dividend of $1.10 per share, reflecting an increase of 25% from the prior quarter, payable on August 2 to shareholders of record on July 9. Additionally, it repurchased shares worth $38 million in the fiscal fourth quarter.\n\n\n\nFor Fiscal 2022, the company expects revenues to come in the range of $9.2 - $9.5 billion. The consensus estimate sits at $9.22 billion. Non-GAAP net earnings per share are expected in the $7.00 - $7.50 band, versus consensus estimates of $7.21 per share.\n\n\n\nFollowing the fiscal Q4 earnings release, Truist Financial analyst Jake Bartlett reiterated a Buy rating on the stock but decreased the price target to $167.00 from $170.00. This implies 19.4% upside potential to current levels.\n\n\n\nConsensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 17 Buys and 5 Holds. The average DRI analyst price target of $160.50 implies 14.8% upside potential from the current levels. Shares have gained 87.5% over the past year.\n\n\n\nTipRanks data shows that financial blogger opinions are 94% Bullish on DRI, compared to a sector average of 70%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated news :Why is Sundial Growers Trading to the Moon?Will Twitter Tweet More Loudly?Entera Bio Surging on Drug Development; Will the Rise Continue?", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ee6afcae0bf6bc832b13d02e73168113567cbd9bdaad2a2cd6e101864b7f065d"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1624570560, "headline": "Dow rises 300 points, S&P 500 and Nasdaq score records after Biden announces infrastructure deal", "id": 68474072, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kXVkQ3q0cgijsup75peEHw--~B/aD02NDA7dz0xMjgwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/marketwatch.com/1717ee1eced45b31b74b1d34b2b24b1e", "related": "DRI", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average ends sharply higher, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite finish in record territory, after President Joe Biden said the White House had reached a deal with a bipartisan group of lawmakers on an infrastructure plan.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7b8e0d879b53bb29c7717b5c1df2740983142074942df5157d560e2b808aff2d"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1624565755, "headline": "Infrastructure deal produced a 'jailbreak' moment on Wall Street, Jim Cramer says", "id": 68480382, "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106902246-16245552602021-06-24t165031z_232425267_rc247o9ajssb_rtrmadp_0_usa-biden-infrastructure.jpeg?v=1624555295", "related": "DRI", "source": "CNBC", "summary": "Wall Street saw a breakout moment in Thursday trading as stocks rallied after lawmakers in Washington agreed on an infrastructure deal, CNBC's Jim Cramer said.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=74ff06cc711a6edd247508f4497f3a53290f4bfe1ed27923909953187473cfc0"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1624564812, "headline": "Darden Restaurants Inc (DRI) Q4 2021 Earnings Call Transcript", "id": 68476475, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zmj.74VZmDKFyMQXCAbujg--~B/aD0xNDk0O3c9MTQwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/e48e86dda35543079ee2080fd9208b73", "related": "DRI", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "DRI earnings call for the period ending May 30, 2021.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=5ddbd0aeff96c35be077052bdc507376332cddf9b542e439be136b16326318ed"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1624557000, "headline": "Dow extends gains, up over 300 points, after Biden announces infrastructure deal", "id": 68466829, "image": "", "related": "DRI", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average extended gains Thursday afternoon, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite continued to trade in record territory, after President Joe Biden said the White House had reached a deal with a bipartisan group of lawmakers on an infrastructure plan.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4585c78311d3ee5d1c973d734686492136dde5bd5f1122e3855d056c6537e91a"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1624553400, "headline": "Darden Restaurants Inc. stock rises Thursday, outperforms market", "id": 68478070, "image": "https://images.mktw.net/im-220105/social", "related": "DRI", "source": "MarketWatch", "summary": "Shares of Darden Restaurants Inc. advanced 3.25% to $139.85 Thursday, on what proved to be an all-around favorable trading session for the stock market, with...", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c2208788ec2c8e4751609a0c919c2825536f98bf7a7c961bd2a909b7abf288d1"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1624551840, "headline": "Eli Lilly, Steelcase rise; KB Home, H.B.

"source": "Yahoo", "summary": "President Joe Biden has been taking bold actions, like the massive stimulus bill. And of course, he has more plans in the works, like the infrastructure plan. Investors are trying to figure out which companies will benefit. It\u2019s important to recognize that President Biden\u2019s policies will also have adverse impacts on some businesses. Perhaps one of the biggest impacts could be the support of unions. With growing concerns about inflation, unions may see a resurgence \u2014 and this could put pressure on the profits for Corporate America. There are various studies that have looked at how labor unions can impact the bottom line. For example, there was one \u2013 from St. Francis Xavier University professor Hatem Ghouma, King Saud University professor Abdullah Aldahmesh and Hamdi Ben-Nasr \u2013 that analyzed data from 1984-2013.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The outcome? Well, the influence of labor unions can lead to a \u201cstock price crash risk\u201d! 7 Great Stocks to Buy Under $10 So if President Biden\u2019s actions lead to more union activity, which companies could be negatively impacted? Let\u2019s take a look at seven: Target (NYSE:TGT) TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) Macy\u2019s (NYSE:M) Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Stocks Watching Biden Administration\u2019s Impact: Target (TGT) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Last year was particularly strong for Target as the novel corona virus spurred a big increase in consumer spending there. Comparable sales growth was 19.3% and there was a $9.3 billion improvement in marketshare. In a show of appreciation to the hard work of its employees, Target did provide a $500 bonus for its hourly workers. The minimum wage was also set to $15 per hour. But there could still be pressure from unions. For example, a Target warehouse center in New Jersey has indicated an intention to unionize. Let\u2019s face it, such jobs can be so stressful. But of course, the warehouse part of the business has become a major source of profits for Target because of the importance of ecommerce. It\u2019s not clear how many employees are in these facilities \u2013 but the headcount is likely growing. As for the total base across the company, it\u2019s about 368,000. TJX Companies (TJX) Source: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.com TJX Companies has been effective in navigating the impact of the novel coronavirus. During the fourth quarter, the open-only comp store sales were off only about 3%. The company has also been able to maintain robust profitability. It certainly helps that the company is highly disciplined with its costs. It\u2019s all a part of the low-price model. 7 Big Names That Could Be the Next Tesla But this could make it vulnerable to the pro-union focus of President Biden. Note that TJX is a fairly large organization with about 320,000 employees. And a union drive could really have a material impact on margins. Macy\u2019s (M) Source: digitalreflections / Shutterstock.com Even with the cost cutting and unloading of stores, Macy\u2019s still has a large employee base. It\u2019s around 75,000. Since Macy\u2019s has been around for decades, the company is unionized, but this represents a fairly small part of the workforce. But if it gets easier to expand on this \u2014 such as with the policies of President Biden \u2014 the impact could mean a squeeze on the bottom line. After all, Macy\u2019s still must deal with the secular trends to ecommerce, battling giants like Amazon. And while the company has been making investments in its digital offerings, they have still not been enough to reverse the pressures on revenues. Tesla (TSLA) Source: Grisha Bruev / Shutterstock.com The auto industry has historically been heavily unionized. But Tesla has been able to buck that trend. Hey, there is little doubt that the company\u2019s cofounder and CEO Elon Musk is no fan of unions. Keep in mind that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) recently ruled that he violated the labor laws by firing a union activist in 2018. It was actually in regard to the following tweet: \u201cNothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing?\u201d One of the consequences of the NLRB action is that Tesla will have to amend its confidentiality agreements to allow its employees to freely talk with the media about their labor situations. The company will also have to provide notices about their labor rights. 7 Monthly Dividend Stocks That Pay the Bills Tesla has over 70,000 employees \u2013 and the headcount is growing at a rapid clip. So given that United Autoworkers has a lot of power and may be emboldened by President Biden, there could be more unionization efforts at the company. Still, Biden\u2019s ambitious electric vehicle initiatives could provide tailwinds for TSLA stock at the same time. Darden Restaurants (DRI) Source: Shutterstock The restaurant business is tough. There is wide-spread competition and, of course, the labor costs are substantial \u2014 as is the turnover rate. Thus, if there is more unionization, the impact could be significant. One of the largest restaurant operators in the U.S. is Darden Restaurants. The company has over 175,000 employees and operates chains like Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Yard House and Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen. Yet it is taking some proactive steps to head off the efforts of unions. For example, Darden Restaurants recently set aside $17 million in bonuses and increased the minimum hourly pay $10. However, in light of Biden\u2019s plans, this may not prove to be enough. Keep in mind that there is a growing movement in the restaurant industry to \u201cFight for $15\u201d for the minimum wage and Darden Restaurants has definitely been a target of this. Alphabet (GOOGL) Source: Benny Marty / Shutterstock.com There are currently more than 800 members of the Alphabet Workers Union, which is associated with the Communications Workers of America Local 1400. Even though the union is fairly small, it may be a sign of more unionization to come. But, interestingly enough, the focus is not on wages. Alphabet is known for being competitive in regards to compensation. The reality is that it\u2019s tough to attract and retain high level technical talent. But there is still likely to be an effect. The reason is that employees at large tech companies are mindful of their responsibilities and impact on society. There are potential threats with AI (Artificial Intelligence) and other new technologies. 7 Cheap Stocks with Growing Tailwinds The issue for a company like Alphabet is that its business model is often at odds with such things as privacy. In other words, if unions become more prevalent, it could be tougher for the company to monetize its platforms. Amazon (AMZN) Source: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has supported President Biden\u2019s infrastructure plan \u2014 even the proposed corporate tax increases. Yet he may not be as keen about Biden\u2019s support for unions. And this should come as no surprise. Keep in mind that the company has over one million employees. Something else: employees at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, recently voted against unionizing. Although this may bode well for AMZN shareholders in the short-term, the media attention that this vote garnered could engender other union efforts across the company and corporate America more broadly. So unionization may yet pose a headwind to Amazon, and this could present a growing challenge to the stock.

And while equities always grab the initial headlines, in some ways, it couldn\u2019t come at a worse time for the U.S. corporate-bond market.Since early April, when the Federal Reserve outlined\u00a0its unprecedented intervention into U.S. bond markets,\u00a0corporate debt\u00a0has\u00a0been remarkably consistent, especially when considering the devastating blow to the U.S. economy from the Covid-19 pandemic. Even as stocks had their occasional stumbles, the yield spread between both investment-grade and junk-rated\u00a0securities\u00a0relative to Treasuries narrowed in each of the five months through August, according to Bloomberg Barclays index data. The gap widened a bit last month, but that could be explained away easily enough by the fact that both markets had their busiest September ever and reached record annual supply totals with a full quarter of 2020 remaining. The debt markets, as all onlookers were quick to say, remained wide open to any company that wanted to borrow.That narrative is starting to look dicey. Both high-yield and investment-grade CDX indexes surged on Wednesday by the most in more than a month, reflecting a higher premium demanded by investors to protect against bond defaults. The move mirrored the broader risk-off tone across markets, with the S&P 500 Index at one point slumping by more than 3%, as cities and regions across the globe\u00a0imposed lockdowns to slow the spread of the virus.For credit markets, the sudden sell-off might not be\u00a0the worst of it. Moody\u2019s Investors Service released a report on Wednesday that revealed the amount of debt from U.S. companies considered potential \u201cfallen angels\u201d jumped to a all-time high of $254 billion in the third quarter, from $217 billion at the end of June. These are bonds from companies rated Baa3, one step above junk status, with either negative outlooks or expressly on review for a downgrade below investment grade. Just to name a few of these potential fallen angels: Choice Hotels International Inc., Darden Restaurants Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc., Expedia Group Inc., Hyatt Hotels Corp., Las Vegas Sands Corp., Marriott International Inc. and\u00a0Nordstrom Inc. You get the picture.It\u2019s been well over 100 days \u2014\u00a0and in some cases more than 200 days \u2014\u00a0since any\u00a0of these companies had their outlooks revised to negative. Moody\u2019s and its peers\u00a0have been relatively patient in monitoring how the virus outbreak develops and how the U.S. economy reacts\u00a0before making\u00a0across-the-board downgrades. Should the current trends persist, however, they might not be able to hold off much longer.While it\u2019s hardly\u00a0perfect, the\u00a0Transportation Security Administration\u2019s daily updates of checkpoint travel numbers serve as something of a proxy for Americans\u2019 willingness to travel and spend time indoors with strangers \u2014\u00a0all of which is critical for the aforementioned companies. Total travelers exceeded 1 million on Oct. 18 for the first time in seven months, pushing the 10-day rolling average to 882,323, the highest level of the Covid-19 era. It has slipped since then, with the number of travelers on\u00a0Tuesday dropping to\u00a0the lowest since Sept. 30. This is entirely consistent with the increase in the number of Americans hospitalized with Covid-19, which has jumped 21.4% since Oct. 18.What\u2019s worse, it\u2019s hard to find a\u00a0positive trend anywhere. Just on Wednesday, France and Germany were preparing for lockdowns, the U.K. reported more than 300 coronavirus deaths for the second day in a row, Italy and Portugal reported record new daily cases and even New York and New Jersey are seeing a resurgence after having a better handle on the virus\u2019s spread\u00a0than other U.S. states for months. Just one week into the Big Ten football season, which President Donald Trump took credit for helping to restart, the University of Wisconsin had to cancel its pending\u00a0matchup with the University of Nebraska after a coronavirus outbreak that reached at least a dozen players and staff members.Curiously, this pessimistic economic outlook didn\u2019t move Treasuries, which would typically rally during risk-off periods. There are probably some election dynamics at play there. As a Bloomberg News article\u00a0noted, \u201cVirus Cases Are Spiking Just When They Could Hurt Trump Most.\u201d To the extent the heightened\u00a0focus on Covid-19 makes a Democratic sweep of the White House and both chambers of Congress more likely, bond traders might be nervous to push yields too low. The\u00a0consensus expectation is that a \u201cblue wave\u201d would bring about a large round of fiscal stimulus and cause long-term benchmark yields to surge.If that curve steepening were to play out, it would present\u00a0its own set of challenges for corporate bonds, which still have all-in yields close to record lows. Would investors be as eager to lend money to at-risk companies amid a broader debt-market selloff? Then there\u2019s the question of whether\u00a0the prospect of a fiscal aid package sometime in the future would outweigh the Covid-19 outbreaks happening in the present. If the economic damage resembles anything close to the March-April period, that could make it tougher and more expensive for companies to borrow. Investors\u00a0will want higher yields to take on the added risk, assuming\u00a0they\u2019ll\u00a0want\u00a0to take on the risk all.\u00a0As always, the Fed looms large during times like this. Yes, Bill Dudley, the former New York Fed president, wrote a Bloomberg Opinion column on Wednesday arguing that \u201cThe Fed Is Really Running Out of Firepower.\u201d But he didn\u2019t mention the central bank\u2019s Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, which as of Sept. 30 owned about $8.6 billion of exchange-traded funds tracking investment-grade and high-yield debt as well as $4.4 billion of individual corporate bonds. There\u2019s nothing preventing\u00a0Chair Jerome Powell from announcing\u00a0during his press conference on Nov. 5 that the Fed will start to ramp up purchases through the SMCCF, which, combined with the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility, can reach up to $750 billion in size. Investors have reason to expect the Fed won\u2019t allow corporate bonds to plummet\u00a0like they did in March.The Fed can cushion the blow to credit markets, but it likely can\u2019t shield them entirely. After months and months of steady gains, investors might have forgotten what it felt like to be blindsided by the Covid-19 pandemic earlier this year.
