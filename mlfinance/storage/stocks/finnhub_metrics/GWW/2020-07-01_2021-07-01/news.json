Grainger (NYSE:GWW) moved lower by 9.49%. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt W.W. Grainger has. W.W. Grainger's Debt According to the W.W. Grainger's most recent financial statement as reported on October 22, 2020, total debt is at $2.40 billion, with $2.39 billion in long-term debt and $12.00 million in current debt. Adjusting for $859.00 million in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $1.54 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering W.W. Grainger's $6.58 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.36. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and average for another. Why Debt Is Important Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital. However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

Grainger (NYSE:GWW) unveils its next round of earnings this Wednesday, February 03. Get prepared with Benzinga's ultimate preview for W.W. Grainger's Q4 earnings. What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. Earnings And Revenue Analysts expect W.W. Grainger earnings of $3.85 per share. Revenue will likely be around $2.92 billion, according to the consensus estimate. In the same quarter last year, W.W. Grainger reported earnings per share of $3.88 on sales of $2.85 billion. Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the \"consensus estimates.\" A company posting earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate is known as an \"earnings surprise\" and may move the stock by a considerable margin. View more earnings on GWW If the company were to report earnings in line when it publishes results Wednesday, earnings would be down 0.77%. Sales would be up 2.56% from the year-ago period. W.W. Grainger's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past like this: Quarter Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 EPS Estimate 4.15 3.24 4.43 4.02 EPS Actual 4.52 3.75 4.24 3.88 Revenue Estimate 2.98 B 2.71 B 2.86 B 2.86 B Revenue Actual 3.02 B 2.84 B 3.00 B 2.85 B Stock Performance For a full 12 months, the return has risen by 18.34%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders are probably relaxed going into this earnings release. Long-term shareholders are already enjoying 12-month gains prior to the announcement. Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call. W.W. Grainger is scheduled to hold the call at 11:00:00 ET and can be accessed here.
