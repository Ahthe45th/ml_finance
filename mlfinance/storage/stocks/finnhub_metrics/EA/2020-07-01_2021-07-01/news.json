The forecast for profit was short of estimates, but the company\u2019s full-year guidance was slightly ahead of what Wall Street predicted.The outlook was upbeat enough to reassure investors. After the stock initially slid in late trading, it recovered to a gain of as much as 3%.Electronic Arts -- and the video-game industry overall -- is hoping for a soft landing after a Covid-fueled sales surge last year. The company\u2019s results come a day after Roblox Corp. said its gaming platform had stayed more robust than expected in April, sending its shares soaring on Tuesday.\u201cRemember, last year\u2019s Q1 was astronomical,\u201d Electronic Arts Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen said in an interview. \u201cIt was a huge quarter because of everyone staying at home.\u201dThe first-quarter earnings miss is also partly due to costs related to recent acquisitions, such as Glu Mobile, Jorgensen said.Meanwhile, the company has managed to establish social networks within its games, Chief Executive Officer Andrew Wilson said during a conference call. That should help maintain sales even as gamers head back to in-person schools and offices.\u201cWe don\u2019t think anything goes back to what it was before -- we think the growth continues,\u201d he said.Apex Legends helped fuel results in the just-completed quarter, which exceeded estimates for sales and profit. The battle-royale game has attracted more than 100 million players to date on consoles and personal computers. And a new version of Battlefield, another key franchise, is slated for release around the holidays -- with promotional trailers coming in June.\u201cHistorically they have been conservative around expenses and generally end up outperforming their margin targets,\u201d said Matthew Kanterman, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cSo overall there\u2019s a lot of encouraging factors.Electronic Arts may continue to be acquisitive. \u201cWe are always looking for great mobile properties, great talent that could help us extend our skills in things like sports,\u201d Jorgensen said.In May, EA bought baseball-game studio Metalhead Software, and in April it closed its acquisition of Glu Mobile, the mobile-gaming company. In February, Electronic Arts completed its purchase of Codemasters, known for its racing games.The shares climbed as high as $145.63 in extended trading. They had been down 1.6% to $141.36 this year through Tuesday\u2019s close.(Updates share reaction starting in third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ae9c5cba9214a069bd139dfe8bb42880af0f04a17201b9aca8716c6f43f0910c"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620769048, "headline": "EA signals gaming boom extending run with upbeat annual forecast", "id": 67758664, "image": "https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20210511&t=2&i=1561734201&r=LYNXMPEH4A1CK", "related": "EA", "source": "Reuters", "summary": "Electronic Arts Inc on Tuesday forecast annual adjusted revenue above analysts' estimates, betting that demand for its titles, including \"FIFA 21\" and \"Apex Legends,\" would stay strong even as COVID-19 restrictions ease.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=dafd6d9d1e258ff7f616c4f02374e9dd2903148ffa60847ff8e22e18bca5834e"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620768781, "headline": "Electronic Arts beats Q1 earnings projections", "id": 67762735, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7vJPOvyx9XaomLtjfWg8tQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTIwMDA7aD0xMTI0/https://s.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/prod/2021-05/11/609af80e901e2526cbfe3524/609af80e901e2526cbfe3525_o_U_v2.jpg", "related": "EA", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre breaks down Electronic Arts' earnings which were relased after the bell on Tuesday.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=9545c91b0bf1d7119eacc7faa1e50dc39efe29146029615ab90fa46af4a6dd81"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620767929, "headline": "Video Game Publisher EA Beats March-Quarter Targets But Earnings Outlook Is Light", "id": 67759517, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/G5y_RlH4FtebcBoJ.s6Nzg--~B/aD01NzI7dz0xMDEyO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ibd.com/aca6dfa6ebe026a6f3051fe880017330", "related": "EA", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "Video game publisher Electronic Arts late Tuesday beat analyst expectations for its fiscal fourth quarter.

Square Enix said it had not received any proposals and wasn\u2019t thinking of a sale.\u201cWe do not consider selling off the company or any part of its businesses, nor have we received any offer from any third party to acquire the company or any part of its businesses,\u201d the company said in a statement.Shares in Square Enix are trading near the all-time high set last year, giving it a market value of 845 billion yen ($7.8 billion). As well as Final Fantasy, it publishes the Dragon Quest and Kingdom Hearts role-playing series, and owns the Tomb Raider franchise.\u201cWith intellectual property that has remained popular for years and years, Square Enix does have strong branding power,\u201d said Shoichi Arisawa, an analyst at Iwai Cosmo Securities Co.Amid increasing competition for the biggest exclusive properties and a surge in revenue as a result of the pandemic, M&A activity in the videogame sector has been growing. 2020 saw almost $25 billion in deals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bulk of that was made up by Microsoft Corp.\u2019s $7.5 billion acquisition of the owner of Bethesda Softworks, the maker of The Elder Scrolls, Doom and Fallout series. Electronic Arts Inc. topped a rival offer from Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. to buy racing game maker Codemasters Group Holdings Plc for $1.2 billion.\u201cM&A will remain robust after record deal volume -- both number of deals and dollar value -- in 2020, with multiple game makers having cash-rich balance sheets,\u201d said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Matthew Kanterman, \u201cbut they will probably target smaller, private developers as opposed to large listed ones.\u201dIt\u2019s far from the first time that the Final Fantasy maker was a possible acquisition target. Before its merger with Enix, Microsoft had intended to acquire Square in 1999, but the deal was rejected for being too low.The report also boosted some other gaming stocks in Tokyo, with Koei Tecmo Holdings Co. rising as much as 2.9%.(Updates with comment from Square Enix from second paragaph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=70f46dbd151b3919fd08a9934e26b40adc43cfe88a08413106f731d90707c3ca"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1618537140, "headline": "Barton Investment Management Buys Duck Creek Technologies Inc, Apple Inc, Sells Electronic Arts ...", "id": 66270872, "image": "https://static.gurufocus.com/photos/gurus/guru_logo_square.jpg", "related": "EA", "source": "GuruFocus", "summary": "Barton Investment Management Buys Duck Creek Technologies Inc, Apple Inc, Sells Electronic Arts Inc, Alphabet Inc, Philip Morris International Inc, Stocks: AAPL,DCT,EA,GOOGL,PM,CL,, release date:Apr 16, 2021", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d9ad733da515c73f8b3251c64672f23ecebf2b1968e6467473b595afcd6c94f0"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1618535760, "headline": "First Week of EA December 17th Options Trading", "id": 66698174, "image": "", "related": "EA", "source": "Stock Options Channel", "summary": "Staff article entitled First Week of EA December 17th Options Trading, about stock options, from Stock Options Channel.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=755a122c8178c43f883eb1b2b001cb8e3d527f96b3be7c9f92d7d339de91cc1c"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1618505400, "headline": "Electronic Arts Inc. stock rises Thursday, still underperforms market", "id": 66158283, "image": "https://images.mktw.net/im-220105/social", "related": "EA", "source": "MarketWatch", "summary": "Shares of Electronic Arts Inc. inched 0.82% higher to $142.77 Thursday, on what proved to be an all-around great trading session for the stock market, with...", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=93ef8bc1ae30894d8ff7d39b554a5d78e20747064d1706762260523358302e1e"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1618498800, "headline": "Feel the Rush and Live the Drama in F1\u00ae 2021 \u2013 A Next-Gen Experience From Codemasters\u00ae", "id": 66557952, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7EV_K3MhGhrI._glC8ktmQ--~B/aD03ODt3PTQ4MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/business-wire.com/4f8a346f1aadd39043d0515f666f02d6", "related": "EA", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "Today, Codemasters\u00ae and Electronic Arts Inc.
