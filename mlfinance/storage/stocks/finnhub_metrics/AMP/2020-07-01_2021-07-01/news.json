The deal also will give Bank of Montreal\u2019s North American wealth management clients access to a range of Columbia Threadneedle products.White, who took the reins of Canada\u2019s fourth-largest lender in 2017, said in January that BMO was looking to \u201charvest investments\u201d in businesses where the returns weren\u2019t good enough or where the bank didn\u2019t see a path to a leadership position, and then redeploy that capital toward better opportunities. Increased competition on fees and a shift to passively managed investments have hampered profitability in the fund industry, prompting banks including Societe Generale SA and Wells Fargo & Co. to sell their asset-management operations.Bloomberg News reported in October that BMO was exploring options for its asset-management operations, including seeking a buyer for parts of the business outside its home market.The unit Bank of Montreal is selling consists mostly of the F&C Asset Management Plc business, which the lender bought for about C$1.3 billion ($1 billion) in 2014, Gabriel Dechaine, an analyst at National Bank of Canada, said in a note to clients. That acquisition, which predated White\u2019s tenure as CEO, was a \u201cquestionable\u201d deal and a \u201chead scratcher at the time it was announced,\u201d so reversing it is a positive move, Dechaine said.Bank of Montreal said the deal won\u2019t have a \u201csignificant\u201d effect on its future earnings run rate but will improve its efficiency ratio, return on equity and common equity tier 1 capital ratio. The sale price is about 0.7% of the unit\u2019s assets under management, which Dechaine said was \u201con the low side,\u201d reflecting the division\u2019s low profitability.\u201cA material boost to BMO\u2019s capital ratios in exchange for a small hit to profits is a good trade-off, especially if BMO can redeploy the proceeds more efficiently down the road,\u201d said Dechaine, who rates Bank of Montreal the equivalent of a buy.Bank of Montreal was little changed at C$114.97 at 9:52 a.m. in Toronto, while Minneapolis-based Ameriprise rose 0.2% to $241.15 in New York.Ameriprise said in a separate statement that the deal, expected to close in the fourth quarter, will give it an additional $124 billion of assets under management in Europe, bringing its total AUM to more than $1.2 trillion. The acquisition will accelerate Ameriprise\u2019s strategy of growing its fee-based businesses and boost the overall contribution from wealth and asset management, the company said.Bank of Montreal has weathered the Covid-19 crisis with strong results from its capital-markets unit, which has benefited from a surge in volatility and trading. And while increased provisions to protect against the possibility of rising defaults have weighed on overall earnings, the lender\u2019s North American personal and commercial banking business has been helped by rising deposits and shrinking costs.(Updates with analyst\u2019s comments, shares starting in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=0d88f7e8e3e270aff6a169d90696c66cccc31de268e05f17685776c088e5a67a"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1618232290, "headline": "UPDATE 2-BMO to sell EMEA asset management unit for $870 mln to focus on North America", "id": 66297223, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "related": "AMP", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "Canada's Bank of Montreal said on Monday it has agreed to sell its EMEA asset management business to Ameriprise Financial Inc for C$1.1 billion ($870 million) in an all-cash transaction to increase its focus on North America.

Here is Benzinga's everything-that-matters guide for this Wednesday's Q3 earnings announcement.Net Income, Earnings, And Earnings Per Share Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings also known as net income is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS.Earnings And Revenue Analysts predict Ameriprise Financial will report earnings of $2.43 per share on revenue of $3.00 billion. Ameriprise Financial reported a per-share profit of $4.24 when it published results during the same quarter last year. Sales in that period totaled $3.32 billion.What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the \"consensus estimates\"; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an \"earnings surprise\", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values.View more earnings on AMPIf the company were to report earnings in line when it publishes results Wednesday, quarterly profit would be down 42.69%. Revenue would be down 9.56% on a year-over-year basis. The company's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past like this:Quarter Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 Q3 2019  EPS Estimate 2.85 3.94 4.28 4.09  EPS Actual 2.64 5.41 4.20 4.24  Revenue Estimate 2.82 B 2.88 B 3.03 B 2.99 B  Revenue Actual 2.71 B 3.00 B 3.29 B 3.32 B  Stock Performance For a full 12 months, the return has risen by 7.76%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders are probably relaxed going into this earnings release. Long-term shareholders are already enjoying 12-month gains prior to the announcement.Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call. Ameriprise Financial is scheduled to hold the call at 09:00:00 ET and can be accessed here.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Preview: Banco Santander Mexico's Earnings  * Preview: CACI International's Earnings(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.
