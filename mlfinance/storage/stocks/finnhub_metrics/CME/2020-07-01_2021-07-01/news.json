A queue has expanded to 47 vessels and 771 barges, with 430 of those heading north and the rest going south, Petty Officer Carlos Galarza of the Coast Guard\u2019s 8th District said Thursday afternoon by email.The Mississippi River is the main artery for U.S. crop exports, with covered barges full of grain and soy floating to terminals along the Gulf of Mexico, while crude oil as well as imported steel also travel through sections of the waterway. Any sustained outage would disrupt shipments out of the Gulf. Corn futures tumbled by the most allowed under CME Group rules partly on speculation that exports would back up.\u201cThe river is the jugular for the export market in the Midwest for both corn and beans,\u201d said Colin Hulse, a senior risk management consultant at StoneX in Kansas City. \u201cThe length of the blockage is important. If they cannot quickly get movement, then it is a big deal. If it slows or restricts movement for a longer period it can be a big deal as well.\u201dThe stoppage along the Mississippi River is the latest calamity to upend the commodities world in recent weeks. Back in March, the Suez Canal was blocked by a giant container ship that got stuck sideways in the vital waterway for almost a week, paralyzing global shipping. And late last week, a cyberattack brought down the largest fuel pipeline in the U.S. for five days, leading to widespread gasoline shortages from Florida to Virginia.A lengthy halt on the Mississippi River could further roil crop markets, where soybeans and corn futures have hit multiyear highs amid adverse weather in Latin America and a buying spree from China. Corn futures fell Thursday by the exchange limit of 40 cents, or 5.6%, to $6.7475 a bushel in Chicago.As a workaround, traders could in theory also send some supplies on trains and divert to ports along the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Few grain and soy buyers were bidding for barges north of the river closure amid uncertainty on when vessel traffic would resume.The crack halting vehicle and waterway traffic is in the truss of the Interstate 40 Hernando DeSoto Bridge, which was found during a routine inspection, according to a Tuesday statement from the Tennessee Department of Transportation.\u201cThe timeline is still undetermined\u201d for the waterway reopening, department spokeswoman Nichole Lawrence said Thursday morning by email.The Army Corp of Engineers could figure out a way to keep automotive traffic closed in order for water traffic to resume under the bridge, according to CRU Group analyst Josh Spoores. It may cause bottlenecks, but most consumers already used to waiting months for supplies to ship are probably fine with some added delays, he said.The New Orleans Port Region moved 47% of waterborne agricultural exports in 2017, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The majority of these exports were bulk grains and bulk grain products, such as corn, soybeans, animal feed and rice. The region also supports a significant amount of edible oil exports, such as soybean and corn oils and even attracted 13% of U.S. waterborne frozen poultry exports in 2017.Some traders speculated that, based on past experience, the river might be partially opened for restricted movements while repairs are being done.\u201cMy sense is that it is not a big deal for river traffic as it will be a short-term disruption,\u201d said Stephen Nicholson, a senior analyst for grains and oilseeds at Rabobank. \u201cThe good news is most of fertilizer has already come up river and soybean exports are at their low point. However, corn exports continue at a strong pace, so we may see a slight delay in corn barges reaching\u201d New Orleans.It may be difficult for exporters to shift much volume to rail, as the capacity to unload trains outside of the New Orleans area is limited, according to Curt Strubhar, vice chairman and risk management consultant at Advance Trading Inc.\u201cThere aren\u2019t many rail unloaders South of the issue,\u201d he said, adding that New Orleans \u201cport elevators aren\u2019t equipped to handle a sharply higher share of rail unloads either.\u201dOf agricultural supplies that floated on barges north of Memphis, about 84% was corn and about 13% was soybeans, according to Mike Steenhoek, executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition, citing USDA data. Overall shipments of corn and soy during the week ended May 8 were 18% higher than a year ago.Agricultural co-operative Growmark\u2019s St. Louis port, which sends corn and soybeans south to New Orleans for export mostly to China and receives fertilizers, will likely close Friday, according to Matt Lurkins, executive director of the firm\u2019s grain division.\u201cFreight was already tight,\u201d Lurkins said in a phone interview. \u201cThen this kind of sent us over the edge.\u201dIf the pause drags on, he said, Growmark could send more grain to processors rather than loading it on barges for export.Small volumes of crude and partly refined oil are shipped by barge on the river as well. In February, 2.85 million barrels moved from the Midwest to the Gulf Coast via barge and tanker, according to government data.Imported steel on barges will be delayed as long as traffic is halted. About 25% of imported steel travels through at least a section of the Mississippi River, according to Wood Mackenzie analyst Cicero Machado, though he said newly arriving foreign steel to ports in New Orleans or Mobile, Alabama can be diverted onto rail cars or trucks.The river also is a major artery for steel shipments within the U.S. and delays could become an issue for automakers in the South that depend on high-strength steels produced in the Midwest, he said.\u201cAt this stage the big question is: is this going to last?\u201d Machado said. \u201cThe issue is not actually in the river, it\u2019s in a bridge over the river -- so perhaps they\u2019re going to find a way to manage the traffic there.\u201d(Adds Coast Guard update in second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b0afe66f2082ea027310770c5d5006e1257799cfd3e125417d7bc4469cbd764c"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620916884, "headline": "The 7 Best Stocks and Cryptos to Buy in May", "id": 67853136, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?223245761", "related": "CME", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=f6a84dc869e7d026af6af5e51e514b82eb65df2a7ef7ed5940e6335e066fec7d"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620904500, "headline": "Cme Group Inc (CME) Sr MD COO Julie Holzrichter Sold $1.3 million of Shares", "id": 67831696, "image": "", "related": "CME", "source": "GuruFocus", "summary": "GuruFocus Article or News written by insider and the topic is about: ", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=f8b6d0411f11909da8826fee2ca74012dd465baad69a575b7237544c3afe39a9"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620901860, "headline": "Buy This Stock Before It Becomes a Dividend Aristocrat", "id": 67801158, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JZBut9W1lwuWAOzS08Ehag--~B/aD05MTI7dz0xNDAwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/45f9680a9901d75d9f34dcbcb3a22ac2", "related": "CME", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "This stock has had 11 straight years of dividend increases and a 15% annualized return on its share price over the past 10 years.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=cadd5c161ec87a3ce4414ebb7dc94d61ac2c106e548c140296eb2ff53c52f10c"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620887460, "headline": "Buy This Stock Before It Becomes a Dividend Aristocrat", "id": 67797939, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?1370082380", "related": "CME", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "Consistency is key for income investors.

Ethereum is the second-largest public Blockchain network by both market capitalization and daily trading volume. It has already undergone remarkable development in its young history and continues to grow steadily. In 2020, an average of $231 million in ether was traded daily on spot exchanges. To start 2021, that number jumped to $2.7 billion. The interest has in part come from the acceleration of Decentralized Finance (Defi), a concept that focuses on blockchains and smart contracts rather than traditional financial intermediaries. It has also come from Ethereum layer 2 solutions \u2013 technology built on top of Ethereum that is highly scalable and efficient -- and sizeable developments with stablecoins, which are mostly anchored on the Ethereum network. As such, the excitement and interest around Ether shows signs of growing acceptance and an appreciation of decentralization. Let\u2019s look at three key reasons for the growing interest in this rapidly changing market: Blockchain Technology To start, there is global adoption and growing interest in blockchain technology. According to a report from Deloitte, 40% of surveyed companies planned to spend at least $5 million on blockchain projects in 2020, and 86% of U.S. companies surveyed built or are in the process of building blockchain teams. 55% of those surveyed said Blockchain was a top five strategic priority. This acceptance and investment is a broad sign that blockchain technology has become more trusted among those looking to use it to improve business processes or use it as a method for transactions. Ethereum has emerged as the most established cryptocurrency for these purposes due to its DeFi and scalability credentials. In addition, 2020 ushered in improvements in crypto market structure, thanks to growing involvement from spot exchanges and custodian projects, as well as enhanced security and regulation to the spot crypto market. Institutional Interest Second, more institutions are warming up to the idea of crypto, which increases demand. In the current macro environment, some may view crypto as a hedge against potential future inflation. Looking to futures markets, institutional demand has certainly helped drive bitcoin markets recently. Average daily open interest in CME Group Bitcoin futures rose 233% in Q4 2020 over the same period in 2019. Additionally, the number of large open interest holders in Bitcoin futures rose to its highest level ever in December with 110 large traders holding more than 25 futures contracts (125 bitcoin equivalent). A Regulated Futures Market Lastly, institutions that include crypto in their portfolios need a trusted venue to manage risk with price transparency and liquidity. The launch of the CME Ether futures contract provides institutional investors a regulated market in which to get exposure to price movements without having to handle the digital asset, or deal with concerns about wallets, custodians, insurance or other barriers to entry. The Ether contract enables participants to invest in and access the cryptocurrency markets, while also managing any crypto-related risks. What's Next? The introduction of listed Ether futures will help to create a forward curve so Ethereum market participants can better manage price risk. In the days ahead, we may see traditional financial institutions such as major hedge funds and asset managers to enter the ether market along with funds that are crypto native. Further, the Ether futures contract will be useful to those hedging their digital exposure accumulated through transacting in the spot market, through mining or lending activities or from fundraising for a project. With ether demand growing, the futures contract performance will be something to watch in the months ahead. Whether viewed as a valuable blockchain technology or a store of value, Ethereum has carved out a large and important place in the market for crypto.

CME Group Ends In-Person Trade, Successfully Launches Micro Bitcoin Futures What Happened: Founded in 1848, CME Group is an exchange that builds markets around derivatives like futures, or agreements to buy and sell assets at a particular price and time in the future. The company has a long-standing history, offering global benchmark products based on interest rates, equity indices, foreign exchange, and commodities. In addition to building products, CME also facilitates and clears trades through its clearinghouse, CME Clearing. The organization\u2019s move to end in-person trade for most products accelerated around 2015, after open outcry fell to just 1% of total volume. Now, only CME\u2019s Eurodollar options pit will continue to operate. Takeaway: The move to end in-person trade comes as the pandemic accelerated the digital disruption in finance; by and large, market participants demand the efficiency, transparency, and prospects of growth electronic markets offer. Adding, CME, in meeting the demands of emerging market participants, recently launched Micro Bitcoin futures, which are 1/10 the size of one bitcoin and 1/50 the size of the standard CME Bitcoin future. The smaller size makes the product easier to consume by smaller participants. The product, thus far, has been well-received trading nearly 2.5 times as many contracts as the standard Bitcoin future, Tuesday.

TikTok Superstar Griffin Johnson Explains His Vision To Innovate And Inspire Influencer marketing, which is on track to become a $15 billion industry by 2022, is a unique way for creators to monetize their content and outreach.

More and more, creators are being faced with a tough decision, innovate or die. 22-year-old Illinois native Griffin Johnson has done just that. The media influencer, who recently made a pivot into angel investing and entrepreneurship, is not only looking to diversify his earnings but also spread increased value to his highly engaged audience, from his experiences networking with the likes of hedge fund manager Steve Cohen, Miami mayor Francis X.

It was a good run.\u201dCME, one of the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange, had already closed floor trading for most futures contracts in Chicago and New York in 2015 as open outcry had fallen to just 1% of total volumes. The options pits in Chicago, with history stretching back 173 years, were the exchange\u2019s last bastion for old-school commodities floor traders.The Eurodollar options pit will be the only one to continue to operate. CME also said it plans to delist its full-size, floor-based S&P 500 futures and options contracts following the expiration of the September 2021 contracts on Sept. 17.The 2009 documentary \u201cFloored\u201d captured the fading swagger of that world, where traders in brightly colored jackets shouting buy and sell orders could make or lose millions of dollars in a single day betting on everything from corn to pork bellies.Stories from the pits are legendary, with tales of hiring 6 foot 6 inch traders so they\u2019d have a physical advantage. Some people put lifts in their shoes.News of the permanent shutdown came on the same day Chicago announced it aims to fully reopen by July 4.\u201cNice slap in the face for all of us that we\u2019re hoping to return to the floor to pull our business and customer base back together,\u201d said Huber. \u201cI will likely stay involved in the business from the screen side, but it will never replace the days on the floor.\u201dFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=eb6b39553648066eedef428d0ac26c0aaa0c442a933701be20da405717dd5411"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620175353, "headline": "CME calls time on most of its physical trading pits", "id": 67552695, "image": "https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20210504&t=2&i=1560933111&r=LYNXMPEH431BF", "related": "CME", "source": "Reuters", "summary": "Futures exchange operator CME Group Inc said on Tuesday it has decided to permanently close the physical trading pits it shut last March due to the COVID-19 pandemic.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=34e7ab15533cbe920e7093adebb6fedc4443e7dbee4e8f4b777b2d5fb4d0dc97"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620175294, "headline": "UPDATE 1-CME calls time on most of its physical trading pits", "id": 67517247, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "related": "CME", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "Futures exchange operator CME Group Inc said on Tuesday it has decided to permanently close the physical trading pits it shut last March due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

He gained tens of thousands of followers on Twitter after his February 2018 congressional testimony in which he advocated for a \u201cdo no harm\u201d regulatory stance toward blockchain products, the comments that earned him his nickname.\u201cIt\u2019s been fascinating to see how the whole ecosystem around crypto is morphing so fast,\u201d Giancarlo said in an interview. There\u2019s a healthy combination of retail and institutional interest in the market for digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ether, he said. Yet the banks have been slow to embrace the new asset class.\u201cThe opportunity for the BlockFis of the world is the traditional lenders haven\u2019t showed up yet, and yet there\u2019s incredible demand\u201d for dollars and other fiat currency to be used to buy crypto, he said. \u201cThe future of money and things of value is digital.\u201dGiancarlo joins a range of former regulators and Wall Street executives who have jumped to industry roles, including Ben Lawsky, the former head of the New York State Department of Financial Services who\u2019s on the board of Ripple Labs Inc.

They\u2019re lending to hedge funds that need cash to buy Bitcoin for a trade with minimal risk that has been paying out annualized returns that have recently hit 20% to 40%.BlockFi is a akin to a bank for the virtual-currency realm, paying interest on crypto deposits and making cash loans using those holdings as collateral. It also offers a credit card with Bitcoin rewards, as well as a Bitcoin Trust that gives investors exposure without requiring actual purchases of the digital currency.Giancarlo recalled his time at the CFTC when Cboe and CME Group self-certified the first U.S. Bitcoin futures contracts.\u201cIt was not without its controversy,\u201d he said, adding that Thomas Peterffy, chairman of Interactive Brokers, placed a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal decrying the move and saying words to the effect of, \u201cDon\u2019t let Bitcoin futures come about or the western world will end.\u201d Even Wall Street\u2019s futures group, the Futures Industry Association, was against the idea, he said.While Cboe dropped its Bitcoin contract, CME Group\u2019s has been a success, and the exchange recently added Ether futures.Giancarlo also serves as senior counsel to law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, is on the advisory board of the Chamber of Digital Commerce and acts as an independent director of the American Financial Exchange. He was recently nominated to the board of Nomura Holdings Inc. and is a co-founder of the Digital Dollar Project.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=f453af55fc140cafd3fe8480c98f1560a3175d6e9298be1e57c403f3873ae230"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1618916400, "headline": "CME Group to Launch Mexican F-TIIE Interest Rate Futures", "id": 66607689, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dGY6aCmM1B9ce75xfbxTwA--~B/aD0xNjt3PTE2O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/prnewswire.com/75e89591e94b20c2e2c51f959e17e07f", "related": "CME", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "CME Group, the world's leading and most diverse derivatives marketplace, today announced it will introduce interest rate futures based on the Central Bank of Mexico's Overnight TIIE funding rate (F-TIIE).

The chip they\u2019re developing aims to run artificial intelligence more efficiently, which could cut precious millionths of a second off the reaction times of automatic-trading machines.That\u2019s a bold claim in the absence of a completed prototype, but fitting for a company named Rebellions because Park wants to disrupt the industry like the French Revolution upended the European country more than two centuries ago.It could also be a big deal if it pans out. Such is the state of speed in financial markets after traders spent the past decade shaving milliseconds -- or thousandths of a second, an eternity compared with the time scale Rebellions operates in -- off their reaction times by constructing nearly light-speed wireless networks spanning continents and crossing oceans.Since those networks are bumping up against the limits of physics -- nothing in the universe, not even traders\u2019 wireless signals, can go faster than the speed of light -- edges are being found elsewhere. That includes traders trying to coax their machines to process data faster, so orders can be placed quicker.\u201cAn AI chip could halve the microseconds needed to make the orders,\u201d said Park, 37, the chief executive officer of Rebellions and holder of a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cThere are some companies that just continue to stick to the technology they are used to -- we want to change that.\u201dQuicker AlgoThe technology Rebellions is developing is called an application-specific integrated circuit, or ASIC -- a chip designed to do a single thing well, as opposed to general purpose microprocessors like the ones Intel Corp. made famous. This focus could help the Rebellions product run traders\u2019 algorithms more efficiently than alternatives.That\u2019s the idea, anyway.Rebellions is on an \u201cunlimited\u201d hiring spree, aiming to quadruple its 20-person workforce by 2023, Park said. It has gotten 5.5 billion won ($4.9 million) of investments from firms including Kakao Ventures, which is part of messaging giant Kakao Corp., and Shinhan Capital Ltd., a subsidiary of one of Korea\u2019s biggest financial holding companies.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of money in the market with rates so low,\u201d said Park. \u201cSouth Korea is home to chip giants like Samsung, and the age of artificial intelligence is coming -- it is the perfect time to do business.\u201dRebellions plans to have a prototype ready in the second half of the year. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world\u2019s largest contract chipmaker, has agreed to begin making the ASICs in 2022. A few investment banks and quantitative trading firms are in talks to use them, Park said. He declined to identify them.Major Competition\u201cAnything that reduces latencies and improves speed will be important and be adopted by the industry,\u201d said Richard Repetto, an analyst at Piper Sandler & Co. in New York. However, with trading speeds already so fast, creating a faster chip \u201cis just not the arms race it was before,\u201d he added.Major traders have in the past taken steps to get microseconds faster. CME Group Inc. runs one of the world\u2019s biggest exchanges out of a data center in Aurora, Illinois, a town near Chicago. DRW Holdings LLC, a big derivatives trader, about half a decade ago attached an antenna on a utility pole beside the CME facility, gaining something like a microsecond edge on competitors whose wireless rigs were on a tower further away.To catch up, another Chicago-based heavyweight, Jump Trading LLC, spent $14 million buying land across the street from the data center -- setting a new benchmark for the value of a microsecond in modern markets.Firms using the Rebellions ASIC could see \u201csignificant P&L improvement\u201d from speeding up each trade, Park said, speaking from his experience as one of the operators behind Morgan Stanley\u2019s trading machines for two years.High-speed trading is still in its early stages in Rebellions\u2019 home country of South Korea. But, according to Larry Tabb, head of market structure research at Bloomberg Intelligence, in 2021 it\u2019s accounted for as much as 57% of U.S. stock market volume, where high-frequency traders Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial Inc. are dominant.Park faces competition from other AI-focused ASICs. They include Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Unit, a chip that helps power products like Gmail and Google Translate, and Groq Inc., founded by former members of Google\u2019s TPU team. Intel acquired Habana Labs Ltd. in 2019 to boost its AI-chip prowess.Park is thinking big.

What Happened: \u201cI think we\u2019re very, very close to perhaps an intermediate-term top here. A little bit of a correction is certainly due at this point,\u201d Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management, said Tuesday on CNBC\u2019s \u201cTrading Nation.\u201d BTC traded 0.54% lower at $59,354.38 over the past 24 hours at press time, but was up 11.2% over the past week, indicating a recovery. It has an all-time high of $61,683, hit last month. See also: How to Buy Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin\u2019s Recent Gains: The cryptocurrency\u2019s recent gains came after PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL) said it will allow its U.S. customers to use their cryptocurrency holdings to pay at millions of online merchants around the globe. PayPal\u2019s move came a day after payments giant Visa Inc (NYSE: V) said it would allow payments to be settled directly via cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain. Schlossberg noted that Bitcoin\u2019s high degree of volatility will likely mean transactions on platforms such as PayPal\u2019s will be \u201cinfinitesimally small\u201d compared to regular currency. However, he feels Bitcoin is a better store of value than gold. See Also: Why Is Ethereum Surging, Outperforming Bitcoin Today? CME Group\u2019s Plan: Further, Schlossberg said that derivative exchange CME Group Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ: CME) plan to launch Micro Bitcoin futures contracts on its platform in early May could rattle bitcoin\u2019s price even if investors like it or not. The Micro Bitcoin futures will be one-tenth the size of one Bitcoin. Schlossberg noted that Bitcoin topped out the last time CME launched bitcoin futures in late 2017. Matt Maley, chief marketing strategist at Miller Tabak, said in the same \u201cTrading Nation\u201d interview that if Bitcoin moves to the downside below $52,000, its going to be a \u201cbig warning flag\u201d and give the cryptocurrency its first lower low of the year. Maley added it Bitcoin breaks above its recent highs of $61,000, it \u201cshould see another leg higher.\u201d However, he agreed with Schlossberg that bitcoin is going to see a lot more big declines along its way in a very volatile session.

What Happened: \u201cMicro Bitcoin futures will be one-tenth the size of one Bitcoin,\u201d said the CME Group in a press release. The smaller-sized contract will go live on May 3, and provide a wider range of market participants with another tool to hedge against their Bitcoin spot positions. According to the group, traders will be able to get the same features of Bitcoin futures (BTC) in a smaller slice, while enjoying the benefits of trading on a regulated exchange. The new contract will be cash-settled and based on the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate, which serves as the current reference rate for CME\u2019s Bitcoin futures contracts. Why It Matters: \"Since the launch of our Bitcoin futures contract in 2017, we have seen steady, ongoing growth of liquidity and market participation in our crypto derivatives, especially among institutional traders,\" said Tim McCourt, CME Group Global Head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Products. McCourt also noted that the introduction of these Micro Bitcoin futures was a result of demand for smaller-sized contracts from a broad array of clients. Over 13,800 CME Bitcoin futures contracts and 767 Ether futures have traded hands each day, since the beginning of 2021. While CME\u2019s traders have largely been institutions, these new \u201cmini futures\u201d could potentially open up a new demographic of active retail for the derivatives exchange. Price Action: Bitcoin was trading at $58,903 at the time of writing, up 2.43% after an influx of announcements that had a positive impact on its price over the past 24-hours.
