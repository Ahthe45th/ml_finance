And with case counts soaring across Bangalore and much of India, work-from-home arrangements that have sustained Wall Street\u2019s back-office operations for months are coming under intense strain. A growing number of employees are either sick or scrambling to find critical medical supplies such as oxygen for relatives or friends.Standard Chartered Plc said last week that about 800 of its 20,000 staffers in India were infected. As many as 25% of employees in some teams at UBS are absent, said an executive at the firm who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing his job. At Wells Fargo & Co.\u2019s offices in Bangalore and Hyderabad, work on co-branded cards, balance transfers and reward programs is running behind schedule, an executive said.While banks have so far avoided major disruptions by shifting tasks to other offshore hubs, India\u2019s Covid crisis has exposed a little-discussed vulnerability for companies that have spent decades outsourcing functions to the country. India\u2019s outbreak is intensifying even as vaccinations fuel economic recoveries in other parts of the world, heightening fears of a back-office bottleneck at a time when Wall Street firms have rarely been busier.\u201cThis is not a local, India-only problem, this is a global crisis,\u201d said D.D. Mishra, senior director analyst at researcher Gartner Inc. The current wave will be \u201csignificantly bigger\u201d and organizations with India-based staff \u201cwill need to take action to plan for and mitigate if needed,\u201d Mishra and his colleagues wrote in a note last week.Nasscom, the key lobby group for India\u2019s $194 billion outsourcing industry and its almost 5 million employees, has downplayed the threat to operations. But Mishra and fellow analysts at Gartner say they\u2019re fielding a daily flood of calls from anxious global clients asking about the Covid-19 situation.India\u2019s total coronavirus infections have exceeded 21 million, of which about 7 million were added since mid-April. The state of Karnataka, whose capital is Bangalore, reported more than 50,000 new infections for the latest 24-hour period for the first time, almost half of them in the city.Experts have warned the crisis has the potential to worsen in the coming weeks, with one model predicting as many as 1,018,879 deaths by the end of July, quadrupling from the current official count of 230,168. A model prepared by government advisers suggests the wave could peak in the coming days, but the group\u2019s projections have been changing and were wrong last month.In Bangalore, Delhi and Mumbai, the three main bases for the financial giants\u2019 operations, infection rates have reached such alarming levels that local governments have ordered stringent restrictions on movement.While the crisis has hit swathes of the nation\u2019s $2.9 trillion economy, the latest wave has notably affected the twenty-something segment of the population that dominates outsourcing companies and is hard to replace. Most of them are English-speaking, technically-skilled workers.Continuity PlanningFor now, back-office units are marshaling part-time workers or asking employees to perform multiple roles and re-assigning staff to make up for those who are absent. They are scheduling overtime, deferring low-priority projects and conducting pandemic continuity planning exercises for multiple locations should the virus wave intensify.A Wells Fargo employee said some work is getting transferred to the Philippines, where staff is working overnight shifts to pick up the slack. The San Francisco-based bank employs about 35,000 workers in India to help process car, home and personal loans, make collections, and assist customers who need to open, update or close their bank accounts. The company didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.An employee at UBS said that with many of the bank\u2019s 8,000 staff in Mumbai, Pune and Hyderabad absent, work is being shipped to centers such as Poland. The Swiss bank\u2019s workers in India handle trade settlement, transaction reporting, investment banking support and wealth management. Many of the tasks require same-day or next-day turnarounds. A UBS representative didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.With uncertainty surrounding how soon the Indian government will contain the crisis, one executive who asked not to be identified likened the situation to flying blind without any idea how many employees will be affected from one week to the next.Rebalancing Loads\u201cWe are looking carefully at how we can rebalance loads,\u201d Standard Chartered Chief Executive Officer Bill Winters said on an earnings call last week, noting that some work has been routed to Kuala Lumpur, Tianjin and Warsaw. \u201cIn any case, we think we are very well provided for.\u201dBarclays Plc CEO Jes Staley said some functions were shifted to the U.K. from India. Call volumes have increased and people are distressed, he said, adding that signs of pressure was something to watch for. The bank has 20,000 employees in India.Last year, when a sudden lockdown ordered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi saw these banks scrambling to keep their operations running, the European Banking Authority said the push to outsource support functions \u201cexposed these banks to operational risks.\u201dAfter asking their employees to work from home en masse last year, most of them have continued to operate at near 100% work-from-home levels. Natwest Group Plc\u2019s workforce in Bangalore, Delhi and the southern city of Chennai -- accounting for a fifth of its global total -- is completely set up to work from home.Management BandwidthSimilarly, thousands of Goldman employees are working from home, doing high-end business tasks such as risk modeling, accounting compliance and app building. A representative for the bank said workflows can be absorbed by the wider team if needed and there\u2019s been no material impact so far.Citigroup Inc. said there\u2019s currently no significant disruption, while Deutsche Bank AG said employees were working seamlessly from home. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. detailed relief efforts they are undertaking, but didn\u2019t elaborate on the impact on their operations. Last week, HSBC Holdings Plc Chief Executive Officer Noel Quinn said he\u2019s \u201cwatching it closely\u201d and ruled out any material impact at this stage.Besides worrying about disruptions to operations, employee well-being and securing medical help are also taking up a lot of management bandwidth at every large outsourcing unit.At a recent all-hands, virtual corporate strategy team meeting at Accenture Plc, for instance, the talk wasn\u2019t about the usual pay-raises or promotions. Instead, worker after worker demanded flexibility, reduced workloads and no-meeting Fridays, an executive said, asking not to be named discussing internal company matter.Their size has become a hindrance, one executive said, but it\u2019s not clear where else they can go for talent and scale, he added.\u201cWe are telling clients they need to relax service levels and reduce expectations for the coming few weeks,\u201d said Mishra, the Gartner analyst. \u201cThis not a normal situation.\u201d(Updates with model predicting peak in ninth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=8f699fbb4e5cb4f4767aa1fca8656d8dd08e43b0661043a082d3f3688d747df3"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620367980, "headline": "Accenture PLC Stock Is Estimated To Be Significantly Overvalued", "id": 67680488, "image": "", "related": "ACN", "source": "GuruFocus", "summary": "GuruFocus Article or News written by GF Value and the topic is about: ", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=acd042ef7e616be85ec85e5c40427b6e79ad8ce326224c2693c8863e81297fef"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620318780, "headline": "Accenture PLC Cl A stock rises Thursday, still underperforms market", "id": 67653781, "image": "https://images.mktw.net/im-220105/social", "related": "ACN", "source": "MarketWatch", "summary": "Shares of Accenture PLC Cl A inched 0.57% higher to $291.16 Thursday, on what proved to be an all-around great trading session for the stock market, with the...", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7cc2ca9e15dc810781168440fb92dafc73c0b90463692d66777fbe8d331c4e08"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620304740, "headline": "Altavista Wealth Management, Inc.

Accenture (NYSE:ACN) survey indicates that \u201c3 out of 4 C-suite executives believe that if they don\u2019t scale artificial intelligence in the next five years, they risk going out of business entirely.\u201d Given the potential market size and application across industries, AI stocks have grabbed the attention of investors. The good news is that the artificial intelligence market is still at an early growth stage. Companies that are current leaders in the AI space have ample headroom for expansion. A Kearney article, \u201cEmbrace AI to Survive\u201d opines that \u201cAI has reached only a small fraction of its full potential. The race is on, and some contenders have moved ahead, but nobody has a commanding lead.\u201d Clearly, the market today is just the tip of the iceberg. This presents a big opportunity for AI stocks. It is forecasted that for fiscal year 2021, the AI market is estimated at $327.5 billion. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.5% through FY2024. I will not be surprised if healthy growth sustains beyond this forecast period.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 7 Retail Stocks With E-commerce Locked In Let\u2019s discuss four AI stocks that are positioned to be among the industry leaders in the coming years. These stocks are worth considering for the long-term portfolio. C3.ai (NYSE:AI) ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI Stocks Leading the Pack: C3.ai (AI) Source: shutterstock AI stock has plunged after making highs of $183.90 towards the end of fiscal year 2020. Currently, the stock trades at $69.76, and the deep correction seems like a good buying opportunity. While earnings might have disappointed the markets, there is long-term value in the stock. For the third quarter of 2021, the company reported revenue of $49.1 million, which was higher by 19% on a year-on-year basis. Importantly, subscription revenue was $42.7 million and was higher by 23%. On the flipside, the company continued to report operating level loss. For the year, C3.ai expects operating losses at approximately $50 million. The key point to note is that as recurring subscription revenue increases, cash flows upside is likely. Therefore, I don\u2019t see operating losses as a big concern. It\u2019s worth noting that the company has expanded its market presence in the climate and energy sustainability market. Partners include Microsoft, Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BKR). This segment is likely to accelerate growth in the long-term. In addition, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army and New York Power Authority are among the company\u2019s clients. It seems that C3.ai has a strong base for delivering higher growth in the coming years. The AI stock correction is therefore an opportunity to accumulate. ServiceNow (NOW) Source: Phonlamai Photo / Shutterstock.com NOW stock is another interesting name among AI stocks. The stock has surged by 90% in the last year and looks good for further upside. ServiceNow operates several platforms that includes machine learning, intelligent chatbot, AI-powered search and performance analytics. Recently, the company acquired Intellibot, which is a robotic process automation company. The company already has a robust client base with 6,900 global enterprise customers. From a cash flow visibility perspective, the company has over 95% renewal rate. Furthermore, as of FY2020, subscription service revenue was 95% of the total revenue. For FY2020, ServiceNow reported subscription revenue of $4.3 billion, which was higher by 32% on a y-o-y basis. For the current year, subscription revenue is guided at $5.5 billion. Importantly, the company\u2019s free cash flow was $1.4 billion last year. It seems very likely that FCF will be over $2.0 billion (annualized) over the next 24 months. 7 Great Retirement Stocks for Gen Z Therefore, the company has financial headroom to pursue aggressive organic and inorganic growth. In February 2021, Argus Research raised the price target for NOW stock in the range of $600 to $640. NOW stock is positioned to continue trending higher. Microsoft (MSFT) Source: Peteri / Shutterstock.com Among the bigger technology names, MSFT stock is worth adding in the portfolio of AI stocks. The stock has been in a steady uptrend and valuation still looks attractive at a forward price-to-earnings-ratio of 31.95. Recently, Microsoft announced a deal to acquire Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) at a price of $56 per share. The latter is a cloud and AI software company with a focus on the healthcare sector. The company has strong presence in the U.S. with 77% of U.S. hospitals being Nuance customers. Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft believes that \u201cAI is technology\u2019s most important priority, and healthcare is its most urgent application.\u201d With the acquisition, the company will be positioned to accelerate its presence in the healthcare sector. The above statement also indicates the fact that Microsoft is focused on AI for growth in the coming years. It\u2019s worth noting that Microsoft has also invested in C3.ai with a total exposure of 1.19 million shares. In October 2020, C3.ai, Microsoft and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) entered into a partnership to re-invest CRM with artificial intelligence. I will not be surprised if C3.ai is another potential acquisition target for the Microsoft as it accelerates investments in AI. Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com NVDA stock is another big name to consider among AI stocks. As a leading provider of artificial intelligence chips, the company is positioned for strong growth. In the last year, the biggest development for the company in the AI segment has been the acquisition of Arm Limited for consideration of $40 billion. With the acquisition, \u201cNvida will now be placed at the forefront of Arm\u2019s IoT ecosystem and cloud-based AI edge computing.\u201d Autonomous driving is one segment where Nvidia seems to have made significant inroads. The company will be partnering with TuSimple (NASDAQ:TSP) for autonomous trucks that are likely to commence production in FY2024. Nvidia has also been active in the healthcare segment. In April 2021, the company partnered with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) on a \u201cnew AI research projects using breakthrough transformer neural networks.\u201d As Nvidia spreads its wings across different sectors with AI application, NVDA stock is worth holding in the portfolio. Recently, Raymond James analyst Chris Caso upgraded NVDA stock with a price target of $750. This would imply an upside of 23% from current levels around $608.
