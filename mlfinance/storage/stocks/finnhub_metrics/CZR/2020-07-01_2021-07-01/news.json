Bloomberg reported last year that the company, under a previous CEO, had also been interested in buying the non-U.S. assets of William Hill.The global online gambling market is expected to grow by double digits annually to as much as $158 billion by 2028. That\u2019s sparked a global race by casino operators, sports team owners, media companies and private equity firms looking to establish a strong position in the fast-growing business.Entain itself almost became prey. In January, the parent of U.K. bookmakers Ladbrokes and Coral rejected MGM\u2019s offer as too low and appointed Nygaard-Andersen, an existing board member, as its CEO.\u201cI don\u2019t know if you should say exciting, but it was a busy Christmas and part of January,\u201d said Nygaard-Andersen, 52.In April, Entain took control of Enlabs AB, a Swedish online betting company with a big presence in the Baltics. It\u2019s also making a run for some of the assets of Australia\u2019s Tabcorp Holdings Ltd., a potential $2.7 billion deal.The total volume of casino deals completed or pending has risen 33% to $22 billion so far this year, according to Bloomberg data. Notable transactions include the merger between Bally\u2019s Corp. and Gamesys Group Plc, as well as Apollo Global Management Inc.\u2019s purchase of the Venetian in Las Vegas.Nygaard-Andersen, whose recent experience includes running esports teams and tournaments, sees a convergence between online betting and other forms of digital entertainment, such as video games. She talks about potentially adding a real casino to games like Take-Two Interactive Software Inc.\u2019s Grand Theft Auto, or expanding chances to bet on Fortnite tournaments. But that\u2019s still down the road. Right now, Nygaard-Andersen and her deputy CEO and chief financial officer, Rob Wood, are looking at deals across the globe.April DealWilliam Hill agreed in April to be acquired for $4 billion by Las Vegas-based Caesars, its partner in sports betting in the U.S. Caesars has said it plans to sell the non-U.S. assets within 12 months to pay down $2 billion in debt.Those businesses made up more than 80% of William Hill\u2019s sales last year, according to a public filing. The auction is expected to start in about two weeks, and Caesars\u2019 preferred approach is to sell all of the assets together, said a person familiar with the matter. Chad Beynon, an analyst with Macquarie Securities, estimates their value at about $2.5 billion.One hurdle for Entain could be regulatory, Nygaard-Andersen said. A tie-up With William Hill would give the company a large market share in the U.K.Caesars didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Apollo, which lost out to Caesars on the William Hill acquisition, is also interested in bidding for the non-U.S. assets, and may be the leading candidate, according to people familiar with the matter. Apollo is also bidding against Entain for the Tabcorp assets. Apollo declined to comment.Other private equity firms may be interested, including CVC Capital Partners, which declined to comment. Blackstone Group Inc. considered it, but decided against pursuing the properties, according a person familiar with that company\u2019s thinking.Similar StrategyFlutter Entertainment Plc, owner of the Paddy Power betting shops in Ireland and the FanDuel brand in the U.S., outlined a position somewhat similar to Entain\u2019s on its most recent earnings call.\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019d be an acquirer of a very large number of shops, but we\u2019re always interested in expanding our retail footprint,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Peter Jackson said. \u201cIf there were customer databases or other things that we could acquire in European markets, we\u2019d look at it.\u201dAnother potential suitor for William Hill\u2019s shops is Fred Done, the owner of Betfred, a rival bookmaker that owned about 6% of William Hill before the Caesars deal. A representative said he is still considering his position.Nygaard-Andersen, the first woman to run a U.K.-listed betting company, was unperturbed by the competition or the challenges of a William Hill deal. And the company still has its online betting venture in the U.S. with MGM. The two companies have invested about $500 million in a business that may now be worth more than $10 billion.\u201cThere is a vast amount of opportunities for us,\u201d Nygaard-Andersen said. \u201cSo let\u2019s see.\u201dMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=2c6919ba67c510326d209acc1107c4e072dc34a8de09e7b27b54f908219f8686"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1621326000, "headline": "This Sports-Betting Growth Stock Just Doubled Its Number of Subscribers", "id": 67882204, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?1344471039", "related": "CZR", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "fuboTV (NYSE: FUBO) just hit a grand slam with its first-quarter earnings report.

Casinos outside of Las Vegas have led industry\u2019s recovery because guests don\u2019t have to fly to them. Younger patrons with fewer entertainment options have been among the first to return. Older guests may follow.\u201cAs the world reopens, we already see this capital being unlocked and coming into our doors,\u201d Reeg said. \u201cI think the demand for entertainment and just fun, after the last 12 to 14 months, is going to be like nothing any of us have seen in our lifetime.\u201dThe shares jumped as much as 9.4% to $104.48 during the call. They were up 29% this year through the close Tuesday in New York.Changes PlannedReeg also reiterated plans to sell one of the company\u2019s big Las Vegas hotels and William Hill\u2019s non-U.S. business to help reduce debt. He plans to take the William Hill name off the company\u2019s sportsbooks and app, replacing them with Caesars.Like other Las Vegas resort operators, Caesars has seen an especially steep decline in its meeting and convention business, which has been effectively shut down for the past year. Weekday hotel rates, which depend on that business, remain low. But leisure travel has picked up.On the call, President Anthony Carano said \u201cweekends in Las Vegas are sold out for the foreseeable future.\u201dThe Caesars website showed rooms available at 10 of the company\u2019s Las Vegas resorts this weekend at rates from $179 a night.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=774f2d84752398ca18c5ca1d56dc45f81964533dda11958ddf124a152a9d43c4"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620170403, "headline": "Caesars Entertainment's (CZR) CEO Tom Reeg on Q1 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript", "id": 67522966, "image": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "related": "CZR", "source": "SeekingAlpha", "summary": "Caesars Entertainment, Inc.

Caesars Entertainment will kick off the sale of the bookmaker\u2019s non-US assets in the coming weeks, The Telegraph has learnt. The Las Vegas casino giant completed a deal to buy one of the oldest names in British gambling outright for \u00a32.9bn last month but has signalled it is only interested in retaining the fast-growing American business. Deal insiders said that Apollo is in pole position to acquire the unwanted William Hill assets, which include its high street shops, as well as its UK and European online businesses. The auction could fetch up to \u00a31.5bn, analysts say. Apollo is well prepared for the sale after it considered a bid for the whole of William Hill last year and gained access to its books after expressing interest.

Peter Carlino, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GLPI, commented, \"Our record first quarter financial results highlight our long-term focus on aligning with the industry\u2019s top regional gaming operators, expanding and diversifying our portfolio of regional gaming assets, and supporting our tenants, resulting in the predictability and growth of our rental cash flows and dividends. Our tenant roster features management teams with proven track records in highly-competitive markets which has enabled our tenants to successfully reopen their properties thereby increasing the longer-term visibility of our rental receipts. \u201cOur long-term strategy includes tenant diversification beyond the proven management teams with whom we currently work. In this regard, earlier this month we expanded our relationship with Bally's Corporation in a series of transactions whereby we will acquire the real estate assets of its casino properties in Rock Island, Illinois and Black Hawk, Colorado. We expect the acquisition of the Rock Island and Black Hawk real estate to close early next year and generate incremental annual rent of $12 million. These assets are expected to be added to our previously announced Bally\u2019s master lease for their Tropicana Evansville and Dover Downs Hotel & Casino properties, which is expected to be completed mid-2021. \"We are delighted to expand and diversify our relationship with Bally\u2019s through transactions that deliver strong rent coverage and an accretive cap rate. By adding to the planned master lease with Bally\u2019s, securing rights of first refusal on potential future assets and converting the Tropicana Las Vegas into an income producing ground lease, we expect to drive incremental cash flows while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We expect our tenants' strength, combined with our standing as the sector's only investment-grade balance sheet, to allow GLPI to consistently grow its cash flows and build value for shareholders in 2021 and beyond.\u201d Recent Developments As of April 29, 2021, all of GLPI's 48 properties, (including those owned and operated in the Company's taxable REIT subsidiaries) are open to the public in some capacity.On April 13, 2021, GLPI announced an expansion in its relationship with Bally's Corporation (NYSE: BALY) (\"Bally's\") to acquire the real estate assets of Bally's casino properties in Rock Island, Illinois and Black Hawk, Colorado, for total consideration of $150 million. The parties expect to add the properties to the master lease that will be created in connection with Bally's previously announced acquisitions of Tropicana Evansville and Dover Downs Hotel & Casino (the \"Bally's Master Lease\") (described more fully below). This transaction is expected to generate incremental rent of $12.0 million, with a normalized rent coverage of 2.25x in the first calendar year post-acquisition. The acquisitions of the real estate assets of Bally's properties in Rock Island and Black Hawk are expected to close in early 2022. Additionally, Bally\u2019s granted GLPI a right of first refusal to fund the real property acquisition or development project costs associated with all potential future transactions in Michigan, Maryland, New York and Virginia through one or more sale-leaseback or similar transactions for a term of seven years. Bally\u2019s plans to acquire both GLPI\u2019s non-land real estate assets and Penn National Gaming, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ: PENN) (\"Penn\") outstanding equity interests in Tropicana Las Vegas Hotel and Casino, Inc. for an aggregate cash acquisition price of $150 million. GLPI would retain ownership of the land and concurrently enter into a 50-year ground lease with initial annual rent of $10.5 million. The ground lease would be supported by a Bally\u2019s corporate guarantee and cross-defaulted with the Bally\u2019s Master Lease. This transaction is expected to close in early 2022.Both GLPI and Bally\u2019s have committed to a structure whereby GLPI has the potential to acquire additional assets in sale-leaseback transactions to the extent Bally\u2019s elects to utilize GLPI\u2019s capital as a funding source for their proposed acquisition of Gamesys Group plc. The $500 million commitment provides Bally\u2019s an alternative financing commitment which at GLPI\u2019s sole discretion may be funded in the form of equity, additional prepaid sale-leaseback transactions or secured loans. On December 15, 2020, the Company announced an agreement to sell the operations of Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge (\"HCBR\") to Casino Queen for $28.2 million. GLPI will continue to own the real estate and will enter into an amended master lease with Casino Queen, which will include both their current DraftKings at Casino Queen property in East St. Louis and the HCBR facility, for annual cash rent of $21.4 million with a new initial term of 15 years and four 5-year extensions. This rental amount will be increased annually by 0.5% for the first six years. Beginning with the seventh lease year through the remainder of the lease term, if the Consumer Price Index (\"CPI\") increases by at least 0.25% for any lease year then annual rent shall be increased by 1.25%, and if the CPI increase is less than 0.25% then rent will remain unchanged for such lease year. GLPI will complete the previously announced landside development project at HCBR and the rent under the master lease will be adjusted upon completion to reflect a yield of 8.25% on our project costs. GLPI will also have a right of first refusal with Casino Queen for other sale leaseback transactions for up to an incremental $50 million of rent over the next 2 years. Finally, upon the closing of the transaction, which is expected in the second half of 2021, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, GLPI will receive a one-time cash payment of $4 million in satisfaction of the outstanding loan to Casino Queen. On December 15, 2020, the Company announced that Penn exercised its option to acquire the operations of Hollywood Casino Perryville for $31.1 million in cash. GLPI will enter into a new lease with Penn with an initial term of 20 years, with three 5-year renewal options, for the real estate assets associated with the property for an initial annual cash rent of $7.77 million, $5.83 million of which will be subject to escalation provisions beginning in the second lease year through the fourth lease year and shall increase by 1.50% and then to 1.25% for the remaining lease term. The escalation provisions beginning in the fifth lease year are subject to CPI being at least 0.5% for the preceding lease year. This transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2021, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Since re-opening in May 2020 and June 2020, respectively, HCBR and Hollywood Casino Perryville, the gaming properties GLPI owns and operates in its taxable REIT subsidiary, have generated strong financial results. Total first quarter 2021 net revenues and adjusted EBITDA from these properties exceeded prior-year levels, which were impacted by the temporary closures due to COVID-19, by $10.9 million and $6.8 million, respectively. On October 27, 2020, the Company entered into a series of definitive agreements pursuant to which a subsidiary of Bally's will acquire 100% of the equity interests in the Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ: CZR) (\"Caesars\") subsidiary that currently operates Tropicana Evansville and the Company will reacquire the real property assets of Tropicana Evansville from Caesars for a cash purchase price of approximately $340.0 million. The Company also entered into a real estate purchase agreement with Bally's pursuant to which it will purchase the real estate assets of the Dover Downs Hotel & Casino, located in Dover, Delaware, which is currently owned and operated by Bally's, for a cash purchase price of approximately $144.0 million. At the close of these transactions, which are expected to occur in mid-2021 subject to regulatory approvals, the Tropicana Evansville and Dover Downs Hotel & Casino facilities will be added to the new Bally's Master Lease. The Company anticipates that the Bally's Master Lease will have an initial term of 15 years, with no purchase option, followed by four five-year renewal options (exercisable by Bally's) on the same terms and conditions. Rent under the Bally's Master Lease will be $40.0 million annually and is subject to an annual escalator of up to 2% determined in relation to the annual increase in the CPI. The Company's leases contain variable rent which is reset on varying schedules depending on the lease. In the aggregate, the portion of cash rents that are variable represented approximately 15% of GLPI's 2020 full year cash rental income. Of that 15% variable rent, approximately 29% resets every five years which is associated with the Penn Master Lease and the Casino Queen lease, 41% resets every two years and 30% resets monthly which is associated with the Penn Master Lease (of which approximately 51% is subject to a floor or $22.9 million annually for Hollywood Casino Toledo). The Company does not have any variable rent resets until 2022.In accordance with the rent deferral agreement that was signed in 2020 with Casino Queen, $2.1 million of rent was deferred due to the property's temporary closure in the first quarter of 2021. GLPI anticipates this amount will be collected at the closing of the HCBR transaction. The aggregate first quarter cash dividend of $0.65 per share was paid on March 23, 2021. Dividend On February 22, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors declared a first quarter cash dividend of $0.65 per share on the Company's common stock. The dividend was paid on March 23, 2021 to shareholders of record on March 9, 2021. Portfolio Update GLPI's primary business consists of acquiring, financing, and owning real estate property to be leased to gaming operators in triple-net lease arrangements. As of March 31, 2021, GLPI's portfolio consisted of interests in 48 gaming and related facilities, including approximately 35 acres of real estate at Tropicana Las Vegas and the Company's wholly-owned and operated Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge and Hollywood Casino Perryville, which are referred to as the \"TRS Segment\", the real property associated with 33 gaming and related facilities operated by Penn (excluding the Tropicana Las Vegas), the real property associated with 7 gaming and related facilities operated by Caesars, the real property associated with 4 gaming and related facilities operated by Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE: BYD), and the real property associated with the Casino Queen in East St. Louis, Illinois. These facilities are geographically diversified across 16 states and contain approximately 24.3 million square feet of improvements.

(5) In the third lease year the annual building base rent became $62.1 million and the annual land component was increased to $23.6 million. Building base rent shall be increased by 1.25% annually in the 5th and 6th lease year, 1.75% in the 7th and 8th lease year, and 2% in the 9th lease year and each year thereafter. On December 18, 2020, the Company and Caesars completed an Exchange Agreement (the \"Exchange Agreement\") with subsidiaries of Caesars in which Caesars transferred to the Company the real estate assets of Waterloo and Bettendorf in exchange for the transfer by the Company to Caesars of the real property assets of Tropicana Evansville, plus a cash payment of $5.7 million. In connection with the Exchange Agreement, the annual building base rent was increased to $62.5 million and the annual land component was increased to $23.7 million. Disclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures FFO, FFO per diluted common share, AFFO, AFFO per diluted common share, Adjusted EBITDA and Cash NOI, which are detailed in the reconciliation tables that accompany this release, are used by the Company as performance measures for benchmarking against the Company\u2019s peers and as internal measures of business operating performance, which is used for a bonus metric. The Company believes FFO, FFO per diluted common share, AFFO, AFFO per diluted common share, Adjusted EBITDA and Cash NOI provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance of the Company\u2019s current business. This is especially true since these measures exclude real estate depreciation and we believe that real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight-line basis over time. Cash NOI is rental and other property income, inclusive of rent credits recognized in connection with the Tropicana Las Vegas transaction, less cash property level expenses. Cash NOI excludes depreciation, the amortization of land rights, real estate general and administrative expenses, other non-routine costs and the impact of certain generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) adjustments to rental revenue, such as straight-line rent adjustments and non-cash ground lease income and expense. It is management's view that Cash NOI is a performance measure used to evaluate the operating performance of the Company\u2019s real estate operations and provides investors relevant and useful information because it reflects only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents them on an unleveraged basis. FFO, FFO per diluted common share, AFFO, AFFO per diluted common share, Adjusted EBITDA and Cash NOI are non-GAAP financial measures that are considered supplemental measures for the real estate industry and a supplement to GAAP measures. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding (gains) or losses from sales of property and real estate depreciation. We have defined AFFO as FFO excluding stock based compensation expense, the amortization of debt issuance costs, bond premiums and original issuance discounts, other depreciation, the amortization of land rights, straight-line rent adjustments and losses on debt extinguishment reduced by capital maintenance expenditures. We have defined Adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding interest, taxes on income, depreciation, (gains) or losses from sales of property, stock based compensation expense, straight-line rent adjustments, the amortization of land rights, and losses on debt extinguishment. For financial reporting and debt covenant purposes, the Company includes the amounts of non-cash rents earned in FFO, AFFO, and Adjusted EBITDA. Finally, we have defined Cash NOI as Adjusted EBITDA for the REIT excluding real estate general and administrative expenses and including stock based compensation expense and (gains) or losses from sales of property. FFO, FFO per diluted common share, AFFO, AFFO per diluted common share, Adjusted EBITDA and Cash NOI are not recognized terms under GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures: (i) do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP; (ii) should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities; and (iii) are not alternatives to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. In addition, these measures should not be viewed as an indication of our ability to fund all of our cash needs, including to make cash distributions to our shareholders, to fund capital improvements, or to make interest payments on our indebtedness. Investors are also cautioned that FFO, FFO per share, AFFO, AFFO per share, Adjusted EBITDA and Cash NOI, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate companies, including REITs, due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. Our presentation of these measures does not replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP.
