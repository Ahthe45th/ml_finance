He also said the company won\u2019t be selling any of the Bitcoin it holds.The largest cryptocurrency dropped as much as 15% to just above $46,000, before paring some of the retreat. It was down about 6% to $50,980 as of 1:09 p.m. in Tokyo on Thursday. The rush to sell briefly caused outages at some digital-token exchanges. Bitcoin is still up more than fivefold in the past year.Musk\u2019s move comes after Tesla disclosed in February that it had purchased $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and planned to accept it as a payment. That announcement added legitimacy to the cryptocurrency as an increasingly acceptable form of payment and an investment, especially coming from a large member of the S&P 500 with a high-profile CEO who commands a big following among retail investors and the general public.Tesla\u2019s website, which had a support page dedicated to Bitcoin, noted that the token was the only cryptocurrency that Tesla accepts in the continental U.S. Musk has also tweeted frequently about Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency started as a joke in 2013 -- and he quipped about being the \u201cDogefather\u201d before and during his stint hosting the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d show on May 8. He tweeted on Tuesday, \u201cDo you want Tesla to accept Doge?\u201dTesla\u2019s addition of Bitcoin to its balance sheet was the most visible catalyst during this year\u2019s rally in the digital currency. Bitcoin jumped 16% that day, the biggest one-day gain since the Covid-19 inspired financial markets volatility in March 2020.Optimism grew after Mastercard Inc., Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and other firms moved to make it easier for customers to use cryptocurrencies, fueling the mainstream resurgence that took Bitcoin from about $29,000 at the end of last year to as high as almost $65,000 in April.Bitcoin mining is consuming 66 times more electricity than it did back in late 2015, and the carbon emissions associated with it will likely face increasing scrutiny, according to a recent Citigroup Inc. report.Musk is no stranger to considering the issue of crypto\u2019s environmental impact.Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Investment Management LLC published a report last month saying cryptocurrency mining can drive investment in solar power and make more renewable energy available to the grid. Twitter Inc.\u2019s Jack Dorsey retweeted a post on the white paper with the comment that Bitcoin \u201cincentivizes renewable energy.\u201d Musk replied to Dorsey\u2019s tweet, saying simply, \u201cTrue.\u201dMusk\u2019s tweet on Wednesday took many in the cryptocurrency community by surprise, including Nic Carter, founding partner at Castle Island Ventures, and a leading voice among defenders of Bitcoin\u2019s energy use.\u201cSurely he would have done his diligence prior to accepting Bitcoin?\u2019 Carter said. \u201cVery odd and confusing to see this quick reversal.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear what prompted the decision and Musk and Zachary Kirkhorn, Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer, didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email inquiry for comment. Kirkhorn in March added the tongue-in-cheek title \u201cMaster of Coin,\u201d according to a regulatory filing.Tesla\u2019s first-quarter earnings were bolstered by the sale of 10% of its Bitcoin holdings. Musk said last month the disposal was intended to demonstrate the token\u2019s liquidity, and added that he\u2019s retained his personal investment in the cryptocurrency. Kirkhorn said on an earnings call that the company believes in Bitcoin\u2019s long-term value.(Updates markets in the third paragraph.

The rebound reverses a two-week slump that had pushed Bitcoin below its 100-day moving average amid technical warnings from Wall Street and fears of a growing crypto bubble.Some pinned Monday\u2019s move on a tweet Saturday from billionaire Elon Musk, who in the past has affected prices with his comments on the social platform.In a potential reference to cryptocurrencies, the Tesla Inc. founder asked \u201cWhat does the future hodl?\u201d, using a term often seen as meaning \u201chold on for dear life\u201d that supporters use to refer to buying and holding their digital assets.\u201cThere is always a sharp movement when Tesla\u2019s CEO talks about Bitcoin on Twitter ahead of quarterly earnings,\u201d said Laurent Kssis, global head of exchange-traded products at crypto firm 21Shares AG. \u201cAs the U.S. wakes up, we could see further appreciation leading to $54,000-$54,500.\u201dCryptocurrency-exposed stocks also rose. Monex Group Inc. gained 7.1%, while Remixpoint Inc. increased 7% and Ceres Inc. added 6.1%. In the U.S., Coinbase Global Inc. was up 4.6% in pre-market trading, while Riot Blockchain Inc. jumped 9%.Bitcoin futures weren\u2019t pricing much more in the way of further gains Monday, however. April contracts rose to $53,665, while those for May through September ranged from $52,145 to $55,635, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\u201cBitcoin created a large gap down last week that could stick around far longer than bulls would want to see,\u201d said Rick Bensignor, president of Bensignor Investment Strategies, in a note Monday.Bitcoin has done well over the medium term, retaining a gain of about 80% year-to-date as big-name investors endorse it and institutions from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to Bank of New York Mellon advance their offerings around cryptocurrencies. JPMorgan\u2019s John Normand reiterated in a note Friday that Bitcoin\u2019s ascent has been steeper than any other financial innovation or bubble of the past 50 years.\u201cCrypto bulls breathed a sigh of relief as last week\u2019s deep rout across the space failed to extend,\u201d Steen Jakobsen, chief investment officer at Saxo Bank, wrote in a note.

That promises to remove a barrier that has discouraged some big investors from joining the rush into the Chinese bond market as regulators further open it to those outside the country.BNY Mellon\u2019s move \u201cshould help liquidity and demand for government securities, and incentivize holders of Chinese government bonds, given they now can use them for collateral,\u201d said Sacha Tihanyi, head of emerging market strategy at TD Securities.In a traditional repo agreement, one borrows funds by selling securities to lenders with an agreement to repurchase them back in the future. These securities, usually high-quality assets such as U.S. Treasuries, essentially act as collateral that lenders can seize upon when borrowers default.In a tri-party transaction, a third entity acts as an intermediary between the borrower and lender to facilitate services like collateral selection, payment and settlement.The bank said its platform is custody agnostic, meaning that clients can use BNY Mellon as an agent without having the bank act as the custodian for the assets involved in the trades.BNY Mellon\u2019s move follows a similar program launched in 2018, when the bank allowed clients to pledge Chinese stocks purchased via Hong Kong\u2019s Stock Connect as collateral.\u201cIt is a big deal,\u201d Brian Ruane, chief executive of BNY Mellon\u2019s clearance and collateral management business, said in an interview. \u201cWhile it\u2019s in the early stage of development, over time, this could be a large opportunity, given the size of the fixed-income market.\u201dFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=cff506b94ed4131018f7016dea88ba1d8467fca9da50aeeba2bf05378ad3926c"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1618332000, "headline": "Bank of New York Mellon Corp. stock falls Tuesday, underperforms market", "id": 66143136, "image": "https://images.mktw.net/im-220105/social", "related": "BK", "source": "MarketWatch", "summary": "Shares of Bank of New York Mellon Corp. slid 1.53% to $48.34 Tuesday, on what proved to be an all-around mixed trading session for the stock market, with the...", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=bf618cf7c8616d363ce49a53258c4035584dc9213edd01e3747d98cdcf1fcc77"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1618245600, "headline": "Bank of New York Mellon Corp. stock rises Monday, outperforms market", "id": 66143137, "image": "https://images.mktw.net/im-220105/social", "related": "BK", "source": "MarketWatch", "summary": "Shares of Bank of New York Mellon Corp. inched 0.97% higher to $49.09 Monday, on what proved to be an all-around poor trading session for the stock market,...", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=90b07d588b231783944a1a3b6d827388b424a8a90e8343908978a1527fd4e3d1"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1618230540, "headline": "A Jam-Packed Week Ahead", "id": 66128648, "image": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/og_image_social_share_1200x630/images/story/2012/sigmund-r401qwthw7w-unsplash_1.jpg", "related": "BK", "source": "Benzinga", "summary": "JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u00a0(NYSE: JPM), Goldman Sachs Group Inc\u00a0(NYSE: GS), Delta Air Lines, Inc.
