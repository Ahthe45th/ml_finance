Split Highlights: The split is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022, after which the segment will become a completely separate, publicly-traded company, tentatively dubbed \u201cNewCo.\u201d The independent venture will be based in New Jersey and Massachusetts, with manufacturing sites throughout the U.S., Ireland, and China. The new company will be led by CEO Devdatt Kurdikar, who joined BD in February as president of BD Diabetes Care, and Chief Financial Officer Jacob Elguicze, who joined BD this month and is the former treasurer and head of investor relations for Teleflex. The new company will aim to build on BD\u2019s established footprint in the diabetes care market, where it reported revenues of nearly $1.1 billion for the fiscal year 2020. View more earnings on BDX Numbers: BD currently produces around 8 billion injection devices annually for 30 million patients, leaving plenty of room for NewCo to expand operations to reach approximately 463 million people worldwide with diabetes. BD said separating its diabetes business will give it the space it needs to accumulate the resources and leadership necessary to meet the rising global demand for insulin delivery devices. \u201cThe spinoff will allow BD to strengthen its growth profile, enables a greater investment focus on our other core businesses and high-growth opportunities, and makes a greater impact for our customers and patients,\u201d BD CEO Tom Polen said. \u201cAs a standalone public company, we believe NewCo will be better positioned to leverage its leadership position in insulin delivery to advance vital, innovative solutions to the large and growing number of people living with diabetes worldwide,\u201d Polen added. Price Action: BDX shares are down 3.99% at $239.8 during market trading hours on the last check Thursday.

Bloomberg last month reported that Vicarious and D8 were in merger talks.Charlestown, Massachusetts-based Vicarious, led by Chief Executive Officer Adam Sachs, develops robotics technology with the aim of improving patient outcomes and the efficiency of surgical procedures, while reducing overall health-care costs. Sachs founded the company with Sam Khalifa, its chief technology officer, and Barry Greene, a bariatric and general surgeon, and management will remain in place following the D8 deal.Vicarious, whose technology has been granted \u201cbreakthrough device\u201d designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, is expected to have more than $425 million in cash following the transaction, and estimated 2025 revenues of $355 million.Hong Kong-based D8\u2019s president Donald Tang will join Vicarious\u2019 board, alongside AIDS researcher David Da-I Ho. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter. Once it is complete, Vicarious is set to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RBOT.Surgical RobotsD8 was \u201cblown away\u201d by Vicarious\u2019s technology, Tang said in an interview. \u201cAfter doing due diligence, we were floored by what\u2019s possible in terms of stabilizing surgical procedures,\u201d he said, adding that D8 will seek to leverage its relationships in Asia and elsewhere to help Vicarious expand outside the U.S.A SPAC merger is the \u201cright path\u201d for Vicarious, Sachs said, as the deal bolsters its cash balance by as much as $345 million without the company having to raise multiple private rounds of funding. \u201cAs we move to commercialize our product, being public gives us a level of credibility we may not have had as a private company,\u201d he said.The company is expected to produce its first year of revenue in 2023 and Sachs said its low cost basis will help its products gain traction. He estimates that Vicarious\u2019 technology, which can be inserted into a patient\u2019s body through a 1.5 centimeter incision, is five to ten times cheaper than legacy surgical robots.(Updates throughout with confirmation of earlier report.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=0238062d148fb76ddb28c38e727da4bc927b4d5e5f5341d34b425d59011c0215"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1618470000, "headline": "Vicarious Surgical Inc. and D8 Holdings Corp.

Representatives for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.Cue Health\u2019s tests were used last year by the National Basketball Association to help limit the spread of the coronavirus among team members who played and lived in a so-called bubble in Florida.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in October said it would invest $481 million in the San Diego-based company to boost manufacturing of the tests, which processes results in about 20 minutes. Last month, the tests were given emergency approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for home and over-the-counter use.Venture BackersCue Health, led by co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Ayub Khattak, raised $100 million last June from investors including Madrone Capital Partners, Johnson & Johnson Innovation, Decheng Capital and Foresite Capital.
