The anti-steering policy is at the heart of Epic\u2019s argument that Apple maintains a near-monopoly and juices profits by barring developers from offering alternative payment options in their apps.\u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about it anyway, for consumers to have choice?\u201d Gonzalez Rogers asked Richard Schmalensee, an economist and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, who was testifying Wednesday as an expert witness for Apple in the second week of trial in Oakland, California.Apple, Epic Games Have Simple Way to Avoid Trial: Fully ChargedHer question drew pushback from Schmalensee, who noted that the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 2018 ruling, threw out a lawsuit that accused American Express Co. of thwarting competition by prohibiting merchants from steering customers to cards with lower fees.\u201cIf the app vendor can say, if you press this button you can buy this for less, that means the App Store can\u2019t collect its commission,\u201d Schmalensee said. That amounts to \u201cundercutting\u201d Apple\u2019s App Store sales, he said.Gonzalez Rogers said she didn\u2019t think the situations were \u201cfactually the same.\u201d At stores, customers can see signs that say they can use Visa, MasterCard and other credit card options -- unlike in the App Store. \u201cVisual indications of options don\u2019t exist in this circumstance.\u201dThe fight blew up last year when Apple pulled Epic\u2019s blockbuster Fortnite game from the App Store after Epic let users purchase virtual currency for buying game upgrades through its own payment system.\u201cIf Apple didn\u2019t have these rules, would the problem be solved?\u201d Rogers asked Epic\u2019s economist, David Evans, who also pushed back at the compromise solution when he was on the witness stand Tuesday.\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t eliminate the market power Apple has here, but it would certainly diminish it,\u201d Evans said. For many apps, including game apps that don\u2019t have alternative payment systems, \u201cit would not be much of a solution at all,\u201d he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b6863f797e4276e06db596e4200665e211cea86fbc9920276aefe0c4fb84b1da"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620855909, "headline": "Here's How Much You'd Have If You Invested $1000 in American Express a Decade Ago", "id": 67801303, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/T44Iwg7RbRrkaTIYz_liyQ--~B/aD00Njk7dz05MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/zacks.com/737ffb82e07dc8bffb77e72d153c91f2", "related": "AXP", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "Investing in certain stocks can pay off in the long run, especially if you hold on for a decade or more.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=f4a44383635f4ae3b8a40046b733bdf3f7fa1bfc18e67b45461361da3cbd859d"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620837480, "headline": "American Express Co. stock outperforms competitors despite losses on the day", "id": 67794124, "image": "https://images.mktw.net/im-220105/social", "related": "AXP", "source": "MarketWatch", "summary": "Shares of American Express Co. slid 1.38% to $152.30 Wednesday, on what proved to be an all-around rough trading session for the stock market, with the S&P...", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=85ec2b1e0520b60e237177d595da024673e0ec6b8caec9530783c1386383193f"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620820800, "headline": "American Express and the National Trust for Historic Preservation Announce the 25 recipients of the \"Backing Historic Small Restaurants\" $1+ Million Grant Program", "id": 67771390, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gUvNcG9gNXF7UWrUqCbcfw--~B/aD0zMjA7dz00ODA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/business-wire.com/1e0fa102365360bf713030f7d5418e78", "related": "AXP", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "American Express (NYSE: AXP), and the National Trust for Historic Preservation, today announced the 25 historic and culturally significant restaurants in the U.S. owned by underrepresented groups that will receive funding through the \"Backing Historic Small Restaurants\" Grant Program.

To me, it sounds like the blind leading the blind. Every year, a new hotshot claims to have the inside path to profitable stocks to buy. And more often than not, the market eventually blindsides them. That\u2019s why folks should listen to those who\u2019ve been there before like Warren Buffett. For one thing, Warren Buffett has been investing in blue-chip stocks since the birth of Christ. He\u2019s lived through multiple economic and market cycles so nothing really surprises him. Yes, the individual stocks to buy may look different but in the end, it comes down to the free market principles of supply and demand. And one of the best teachers of profitability exploiting such dynamics is experience. Yet we should realize that Warren Buffett was once young too. Born on Aug. 30, 1930, Buffett graduated from high school when he was 17 years old. He never intended to go to college. However, his father insisted that he attend the Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania. But the younger Buffett only stayed two years, \u201ccomplaining that he knew more than his professors,\u201d according to The Balance contributor Joshua Kennon.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips This sounds to me like Warren Buffett was the original YouTube guru. But the difference is that unlike all the junk that you see on the blogosphere, he knew what he was talking about. Eventually, he would amass a financial empire that would allow him to take control of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B). If you read his bio, you\u2019ll find that Buffett wasn\u2019t just great at picking stocks to buy \u2014 he was a real OG. 7 Stocks to Buy Right Now With All Eyes on Crypto In my view, if you\u2019re going to learn from somebody, it should be a person like Buffett, a man who was born during the Great Depression, went through his youthful exuberance phase, formed a time-proven investment strategy and still continues to fight like the best of \u2018em at 90 freaking years old! Below are some key stocks to buy from the holdings of Berkshire Hathaway. AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) American Express (NYSE:AXP) Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) Chevron (NYSE:CVX) Itochu Corporation (OTCMKTS:ITOCF) Verisign (NASDAQ:VRSN) Now, I should note that despite my high praise for Warren Buffett, he\u2019s not the ultimate arbiter of equity valuations: the market is. Even though these stocks to buy are compelling because they\u2019re on the Berkshire list, nothing is infallible. Maintain money management discipline and a long-term prospective, though, and you should do well in the end. Stocks to Buy: AbbVie (ABBV) Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com Berkshire Hathaway has a number of healthcare-related companies on its list. But the one that caught my attention was AbbVie. Yes, I have some personal bias in that I\u2019ve discussed the bullish case for ABBV stock. But well beyond that, I like to think that Warren Buffett and I are on the same wavelength \u2014 well, at least as long AbbVie specifically is concerned. Yes, everybody knows AbbVie as one of the giant pharmaceutical stocks to buy. It\u2019s perhaps most popular for the drug Humira, which has been formulated to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease and psoriasis, among many other conditions. As well, AbbVie features an extensive list of oncology-related solutions. Should the novel coronavirus outbreak fade out completely, the treatment for long-term diseases should take precedence based on pent-up demand, if you will. But what may really drive ABBV stock is Botox, which came under the AbbVie umbrella when it acquired Allergan. During the Covid-19 lockdowns, there was little incentive to look good. Now that we\u2019re slowly but surely returning to our normal schedules, we have a \u201cright\u201d to be vainer. Cynically, this is good news for ABBV, making it one of the best Berkshire-held stocks to buy. Amazon (AMZN) Source: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com Admittedly, Berkshire doesn\u2019t have nearly as much allocation toward Amazon shares as it does many of its other holdings. At only a 0.1% stake, it\u2019s not Buffett\u2019s highest-conviction trade, that\u2019s for sure. Still, a 0.1% stake is a non-zero number, which means AMZN is one of the stocks to buy or at least to consider. I\u2019m going to get the bad stuff out of the way. Certainly, you can\u2019t deny that AMZN stock has a PR problem. Back during the early days of the Covid-19 crisis, many workers demanded basic dignities, such as paid time off for employees who were sick or displayed Covid-19 symptoms. Not helping matters is that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos consistently swapped places with elite tycoons as the richest person in the world. Yeah, we can talk all day about free market capitalism but come on \u2014 sometimes enough is enough. Still, despite the troubles, Amazon\u2019s relevance can\u2019t be denied. When the brick and mortars had to shut down based on government mandates, e-commerce filled the gap. And Amazon dominates e-commerce. 7 Hot Stocks to Consider for a Greener Future While the percentage of e-commerce sales relative to total retail sales has come down since the peak of the crisis, it\u2019s still very much elevated from pre-pandemic norms. I don\u2019t see this reversing anytime soon, which is why Berkshire includes it on its list of stocks to buy. Stocks to Buy: American Express (AXP) Source: Shutterstock For me, American Express represents a perhaps delusional notion that in certain circumstances, Warren Buffett and I think alike. Generally speaking, I\u2019m somewhat hesitant on credit cards. Certainly, I can see their appeal in the present context. Throughout most of last year, the Covid-19 crisis deflated consumer sentiment, which naturally boosted the personal saving rate. Today, with much of the economy reopening, consumers are ready to spend. Further, you have the stimulus checks that former President Donald Trump and incumbent President Joe Biden signed off on. Thank you, gentlemen. But will such measures really boost spending holistically? Sure, I get the narrative that spending will rise because Americans want to catch up on their retail therapy. But credit cards are debt instruments and consumers historically haven\u2019t shown much restraint with debt instruments. But AXP stock may not suffer from such concerns as the underlying company caters to wealthier individuals. It seems that the folks at Berkshire Hathaway understand this point very clearly. AXP features an 18.9% stake. In contrast, Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) both have a 0.5% stake. So if you\u2019re going to get Buffett-inspired credit card stocks to buy, go for American Express. Charter Communications (CHTR) Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com A classic Warren Buffett move, the inclusion of Charter Communications by Berkshire Hathaway doesn\u2019t surprise me in the least. As a telecommunications and mass-media company under the Charter Spectrum brand name, CHTR was one of the most relevant stocks to buy. Providing high-speed cable and fiber-internet access, along with mobile services, Charter is integral to our modern infrastructure. But with the Covid-19 crisis, CHTR stock became even more ingrained. With millions of white-collar workers forced to operate out of their living rooms, reliable high-speed internet services commanded a premium. Not that it should bear any influence on whether you should acquire shares of Charter Communications but I personally made the switch to Spectrum and I couldn\u2019t be happier. While anecdotal, I\u2019ll tell you what makes CHTR compelling among the Buffett-inspired stocks to buy. Yes, Spectrum\u2019s coverage area spans 44 states. But it\u2019s also where they dominate that matters. For instance, Spectrum has the widest coverage in California, Texas and New York. When you combine the GDP of these three states, you\u2019re talking about $6.55 trillion of economic activity. 8 Blue-Chip Stocks With Strong Earnings Such a combined entity would make it the third-biggest country in the world, usurping Japan. Thus, CHTR is sticking around, which is why Berkshire owns it. Stocks to Buy: Chevron (CVX) Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com Chevron might be one of the surprising stocks to buy on the Berkshire Hathaway list, prompting criticism that perhaps Buffett might be losing it. As you know, American consumers have gravitated toward electric vehicles. And that\u2019s not just a \u201cfashion statement.\u201d Millennials care about sustainability and growing evidence suggests that Generation Z is taking cues, increasing the magnitude of holistic awareness. On the surface, CVX stock doesn\u2019t seem to make much sense. Yes, Chevron and the big oil machinery are relevant today. But tomorrow, the tide will likely turn. It\u2019s not just millennials that consistently influence current affairs. More significantly, government leadership is also pivoting toward a cleaner, more sustainable future. Obviously, the Biden administration wishes to push its environmental protection agenda. Up and coming politicians will probably carry the torch. Big oil stocks to buy are done for. Then again, maybe not. I think CVX may represent a case of Buffett\u2019s contrarianism. This is speculation on my part but it\u2019s possible that Buffett and the Berkshire team don\u2019t view the electrification of transportation as economically viable just yet. Even if it became so, Buffett probably recognizes that oil will be around for a very long time, in part due to the high energy density of fossil fuels. So yeah, CVX is a keeper. Itochu Corporation (ITOCF) Source: VladSV / Shutterstock.com I\u2019m familiar with most of the stocks to buy under the Berkshire umbrella. But the name that caught me by surprise was Itochu Corporation. Frankly, I understand both value and growth investors pivot to Asia. However, this almost always means Chinese companies. On the other hand, Japan hasn\u2019t been making much news aside from deflation-related headlines. So why Itochu? If somebody would ask that question to Warren Buffett, I\u2019d be most grateful as it would give us all a deeper insight into one of the world\u2019s greatest investors. But if I had to guess, it would be Itochu\u2019s exposure to world-class Japanese manufacturing. Itochu is one of Japan\u2019s biggest general trading companies and thus touches on many relevant sectors. But the underlying theme is manufacturing. Interestingly, Harvard Business Review did a story on Japan\u2019s manufacturing prowess. Initially, business experts attributed its outperformance to superior methodologies. But later, these same experts noted that Japan\u2019s production attributes were contradictory to commonly held beliefs: \u201c\u2026many Japanese factories practicing lean manufacturing appeared to surpass their U.S. counterparts on several dimensions; they achieved lower cost, higher quality, faster product introductions, and greater flexibility, all at the same time.\u201d 7 Consumer Stocks to Buy Before Picnic Season Begins In other words, there\u2019s something in the water when it comes to Japanese manufacturing. Buffett might be recognizing this, thus explaining the inclusion of ITOCF stock. Stocks to Buy: Verisign (VRSN) Source: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com Warren Buffett is old. But what I really appreciate about him is that he continues to defy stereotypes. Honestly, at 90 years old, he should be referred to in the past tense. But he\u2019s still out there, leading one of the biggest companies in the world. Good for him and it\u2019s a powerful lesson for all of us. What I especially like is that Buffett isn\u2019t just out there as a charity case. Instead, he\u2019s making bold calls regarding stocks to buy, one of them being Verisign. Well before anyone knew about the SARS-CoV-2 virus, VRSN was an incredibly relevant idea due to its internet network infrastructure operations, including managing the registry for .com and .net domains. That\u2019s serious influence right there. But Covid-19 has dramatically changed the paradigm of work. Though many employees are heading back to the office, several organizations \u2014 including high-level blue chips \u2014 remain open-minded about a full return to normal. And a ton of them are not in a hurry to have everyone clocking back in. There\u2019s also the narrative that many folks who got a taste of the gig worker\u2019s life want to maintain such freedom. To be fair, I\u2019m not sure if companies will allow employees to work 100% from home. Therefore, we could see an increase in independent contract work, which should bolster Verisign\u2019s business. Overall, VRSN stock is one to watch closely as we navigate the post-Covid world.

Revenue fell 44% to $1.25 billion, the Seattle-based company said Thursday in a statement, slightly ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates. Shares climbed about 7% in extended trading.Still, the travel industry remains a \u201cstudy in contrasts,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Peter Kern said, as demand for international and business travel and conventional lodging remain challenged. \u201cBeach and outdoor destinations have shown robust rebounds while major cities remain muted, and some regions have been growing while others remain locked down,\u201d Kern said. \u201cThe market has clearly shown that when people feel safe to travel, demand comes roaring back.\u201dAfter a year of pandemic-related border closures, steep revenue declines and mass layoffs, the travel sector is starting to see the green shoots of recovery. Booking Holdings Inc., the biggest online travel agency, on Wednesday reported a significant jump in the number of room-night reservations made in the beginning of the year. Analysts and industry experts expect the vaccine roll out in the U.S., which makes up more than 50% of Expedia\u2019s revenue, will ignite a 2021 travel boom, driven largely by the alternative accommodation market.Expedia has seen booking trends \u201cwell above 2019 levels,\u201d Kern said on a conference call with analysts after the results were released. Gross bookings, net of cancellations, were down about 40% in January. This improved to 20% in March and continued to show signs of growth into April, Kern said.\u201cThis is an unpredictable time,\u201d Kern said. \u201cThings could get worse before they get better, but we are optimistic we are seeing a lot of improvement across the globe.\u201d The world will open up as the pace of vaccinations continues to increase, he said.Vrbo, which competes directly with Airbnb Inc., has weathered the pandemic better than its parent as travelers sought out regional staycations and remote work getaways. Expedia doesn\u2019t disclose Vrbo metrics, but analysts expect the unit will lead Expedia\u2019s recovery. Cowen analyst Kevin Kopelman estimated Vrbo accounted for more than 40% of Expedia\u2019s gross bookings value in the quarter, up from about 14% in the same period in 2019.Expedia has \u201camped up\u201d its marketing investment in order to woo successful hosts from rival platforms, like Airbnb. \u201cWe are driving it as fast as we can,\u201d Kern said.Truist Securities analyst Naved Khan predicted Vrbo would see \u201crobust growth,\u201d reflecting consumer interest in home rentals amid rising travel demand. \u201cWe estimate that Vrbo\u2019s 2021 revenue could easily be 35% above 2019 levels,\u201d Khan said in an interview before the results were released.Earlier this week, Expedia sold its corporate business travel arm, Egencia, to American Express Global Business Travel. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Expedia will become a shareholder and enter into a long-term commercial agreement with AmEx Global Business Travel as part of the agreement.Expedia reported an adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $58 million. Analysts were expecting a loss of $137.3 million. The adjusted loss per share was $2.02, beating the average analyst estimate of $2.27. Expedia\u2019s shares are up about 25% this year, outperforming Booking and Airbnb, which were both up less than 5%.(Updates with comments from CEO in the fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=fd821a8f0aa84939d62e627c2ae636a657a3114073eedcd0d45b04eeb18113a3"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620331380, "headline": "American Express Declares Regular Quarterly Dividend", "id": 67638232, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TI3pvUMLbeLqLQAU1PVGqg--~B/aD00ODA7dz00ODA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/business-wire.com/363b4b375dfdea439c0bd0d40fbd4b7f", "related": "AXP", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "The Board of Directors of American Express Company (NYSE: AXP) has declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.43 per common share, payable on August 10, 2021, to shareholders of record on July 2, 2021.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c8bad8b027ba0e8fa4c0fc0474fc57f347ab56cab727385cd96eb2a5d79c9999"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620319080, "headline": "American Express Co. stock rises Thursday, still underperforms market", "id": 67655539, "image": "https://images.mktw.net/im-220105/social", "related": "AXP", "source": "MarketWatch", "summary": "Shares of American Express Co. inched 0.31% higher to $156.88 Thursday, on what proved to be an all-around positive trading session for the stock market,...", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=19c957a9f50acf012b8ddb3fce25eaf609dd7337f10240ed1e986206eca94502"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1620316980, "headline": "American Express Declares Regular Quarterly Dividend", "id": 67635832, "image": "", "related": "AXP", "source": "Business Wire", "summary": "Looking for stock market analysis and research with proves results?

The S&P 500 Index (SPX) closed just above 4185 a week ago and finished Thursday near 4135, so it would take a major rally for a green week after the taxman\u2019s visit yesterday. At the same time, there aren\u2019t a lot of new catalysts at work. Friday isn\u2019t the busiest earnings day of the season, but it\u2019s just the calm before the storm. Next week is when the floodgates open and more than 100 S&P 500 companies report, including four of the five \u201cFAANG\u201d companies along with Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). More on that below. By this time a week from now, we should have a much better sense of whether analysts\u2019 average estimate for 24% Q1 earnings growth is in the ballpark or needs adjustment. Despite Signs Of Rebound, Caution Still In Place Yesterday was a rough day thanks in part to new reminders of possible higher taxes (see more below). The Tech sector, especially semiconductors, took a licking, with those shares giving up a lot of Wednesday\u2019s gains. The so-called \u201chorsemen of risk\u201d were in the saddle as bonds and volatility galloped higher. Volatility eased a little this morning, but bonds continued climbing and the 10-year Treasury yield fell below 1.55%\u2014near the bottom of its recent range. It\u2019s been a slow data week, and today ends without many fireworks. The new home sales report for March is about the only big data point today, and analysts expect a steep climb to 912,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis from 775,000 a month earlier, according to research firm Briefing.com. Earnings-wise, companies are getting punished this morning. American Express (NYSE: AXP) and Honeywell (NYSE: HON) are both lower in pre-market trading. The pressure on HON appeared related to disappointment in its aerospace results, which missed the Street\u2019s views. AXP share\u2019s early softness is a classic case of what we\u2019ve been talking about this earnings season: Don\u2019t miss on revenue. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) shares also lost ground after reporting last night. The semiconductor firm may be getting a fish eye from investors because the company faces big costs to build new factories, which could potentially eat into margins. Having said that, it\u2019s never a bad thing to see a company investing for its future, especially one like INTC which faces such heavy competition. One thing that stood out was INTC\u2019s CEO saying the chip shortage could last at least two more years. Think about how that could affect automakers and everyone else. It\u2019s something to keep an eye on, because chips are used everywhere. Snap (NYSE: SNAP) had a very nice quarter. They lost money, but less than expected, revenue was solid, and user numbers looked good. The stock fell at first in pre-market trading, but then hustled back higher. One sector that performed pretty badly Thursday was Materials. Caught in the middle was Dow Inc. (DOW), whose earnings and revenue Thursday exceeded analyst expectations amid what analysts see as strong demand for its chemicals. If you\u2019re an executive at DOW, you\u2019re probably wondering what you have to do to impress Wall Street, considering the company\u2019s guidance also topped consensus views. Barron\u2019s called the selling \u201ca head-scratcher\u201d after a \u201cblockbuster report.\u201d Hard to argue with that. Maybe you\u2019re wondering why it\u2019s so hard for stocks to go up despite decent earnings this quarter. Well, when you\u2019re near all-time highs, it\u2019s hard to get rewarded. It\u2019s not like people are necessarily looking for a reason to buy more stock, especially stocks that have had incredible runs lately. \u201cRead My Lips:\u201d New Tax Proposal Hits Market This isn\u2019t a political column, but sometimes Washington makes it hard not to talk politics in this space. We\u2019re at one of those points after yesterday\u2019s Bloomberg report about the Biden administration possibly planning to raise capital gains taxes and tax rates on high earners. As you probably know by now, the news outlet reported that the Biden administration would increase the rate for the richest Americans to 39.6%, from 37%, percent, while raising the capital gains tax on people earning more than $1 million to 39.6%, from 20%. Stocks immediately took a clobbering on the news. We\u2019re not going to venture an opinion on the proposals themselves. But you can\u2019t help but think that some investors might see the news as a sell signal and try to exit positions ahead of any new taxes coming down from the Beltway. That\u2019s just what tends to happen when there\u2019s news like this. If you\u2019re an investor and had plans to sell anyway, maybe it just puts more oil on the fire to get it done. However, if you\u2019re in the market for the long-term, a new tax proposal or two shouldn\u2019t necessarily affect your day-to-day planning. For one thing, there\u2019s absolutely no certainty that Congress has the ability to pass this proposal. For another thing, tax rates tend to change a lot over time, depending on the administration. It\u2019s like the weather in Chicago: If you don\u2019t like it now, wait a few minutes. While selling definitely picked up yesterday on the tax news, it\u2019s really nothing all that new when you think about it, Briefing.com pointed out. After all, President Biden campaigned on higher taxes for the wealthy. So Thursday\u2019s sell-off might have been one of those times when people were looking for excuses to book some profit and chose that one. Overall, the Materials, Energy, Consumer Discretionary, and Info Tech sectors were hardest hit by selling yesterday. Not a single S&P 500 sector finished in the green. If stocks keep getting pounded today, a possible technical support point might be near the 50-day moving average for the S&P 500 Index (SPX), now at 3970. A drop below that might cause technical selling to pick up. Crude Choppy, Crypto Chopped Crude\u2019s had an odd week. It\u2019s chopped up and down and at one point fell below $60 a barrel amid worries about demand from India and other parts of Asia where Covid cases are up. Since reaching $60 a barrel for the first time post-Covid in mid-February, the crude front-month has been surprisingly stable. It hasn\u2019t fallen much below $60 or risen much above $65 over these two months. If you watch crude over time, you\u2019ll see it often carves a trading range and stays there for a while. It would probably take a move above the 2021 high of $67.98 or a drop below the March low of $57.25 to upset the apple cart much in this market. It\u2019s also been an odd week for Bitcoin. Well, maybe odd isn\u2019t the right word. It\u2019s just getting hammered, and fell below $50,000. That\u2019s after piercing $60,000 for the first time not long ago. One possible reason for the weakness could be worry about how any new tax proposal could affect profits from trading in cryptocurrencies. Remember, that\u2019s still pretty unclear, and remains in the realm of speculation for now. Also, maybe it\u2019s worth noting that the last time the capital gains tax went up (in 2013), the SPX rose 30%. CHART OF THE DAY: BUILDING UP. Need a data point to demonstrate the strength in all things building? Here are two: The S&P Homebuilders Select Industry Index ($SPSIHO\u2014candlestick) and CME Group\u2019s Comex Copper futures (/HG\u2014purple line). As commodity prices continued to surge, homebuilder activity forged ahead in lockstep. Data sources: CME Group, S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim\u00ae platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Broken Record Department: You\u2019ve heard it here before and you\u2019ll hear it again: Earnings drive the market. This may sound like the record is skipping, but it\u2019s true. And if you\u2019re only going to focus on earnings one week out of the quarter, make it this coming week or you\u2019ll miss the top-40 countdown. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are just a few of the big names stepping onto the earnings stage after this weekend. One thing they all have in common, obviously, is exposure to the Tech sector, even if AMZN, GOOGL, and TSLA aren\u2019t officially \u201cTech\u201d stocks. Together, these stocks make up 80% of the so-called \u201cFAANGs,\u201d and MSFT is often thought of as a FAANG cousin who might fit on the list if it\u2019s name didn\u2019t start with a letter that would mess up the cool word. You\u2019re also talking almost $9 trillion in market cap spread across those six stocks. Together, they make up more than a quarter of the S&P 500\u2019s market capitalization, and how they do can really make or break an earnings season. We\u2019ve already previewed GOOGL\u2019s earnings\u2014where advertising revenue and cloud technology are likely to be in focus\u2014and FB, which has seen solid ad revenue growth but may have a couple headwinds ahead. Stay tuned for previews of AAPL, TSLA, and AMZN. Refi High: Speaking of broken records, here\u2019s an oldie but a goodie: with interest rates heading back down after last month\u2019s spike, mortgage applications\u2014and specifically mortgage refinances\u2014are back on the front burner, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). Overall mortgage activity was up 8.6% on the week last week, but refi applications were up 10%, and as of last week make up 60% of all applications. According to Bankrate\u2019s weekly survey, average rates for a 30-year fixed mortgage ticked down six basis points to 3.21% (but still 30 basis points higher than the record low set in January). In and of itself, refis are a good thing for the consumer economy, as they tend to lower a fixed line item in the budget, thus leaving more room for discretionary spending, like home renovations, for example. Where it gets tricky, however, is when refinancers take cash out of their homes (the \u201ccash-out refi\u201d that hit fever pitch just before the financial crisis in 2008). According to Freddie Mac, borrowers cashed out about $48 billion in refis in Q4 2020\u2014the highest level since late 2008. When you look at the trends in housing and commodity prices (see chart above), it\u2019s tempting to conclude we\u2019re setting up for another bruising pullback. But the housing market is fundamentally different than it was in 2008. And considering how unprecedented the pandemic has been, it\u2019s probably folly to compare anything to 2020 and draw conclusions. An Abundance Of You Know What: Before the tax worries cratered Wall Street yesterday, it had been a pretty nice broad-based rally at midweek, if you take the steep Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) losses out of the equation. Still, the better performing sectors over the last week have still been defensive ones like Utilities, Health Care and Real Estate. Plus you have the bond market making some gains and volatility edging higher. Caution seems to be the watchword. That being said, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) couldn\u2019t take out 20 on Thursday and the 10-year yield stayed above its recent 1.52% low. Those could be reckoning points to watch today and next week for hints at the market\u2019s next move. TD Ameritrade\u00ae commentary for educational purposes only. Member SIPC.

The company posted first-quarter net income of $2.2 billion, or $2.74 a share, whereas it recorded net income of $367 million, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier. The net-income figure reflects the impact of $1.05 billion in credit-reserve releases as the economy and credit performance continue to improve. The FactSet consensus was for $1.61 in earnings per share. American Express's revenue, net of interest expense, came in at $9.06 billion, down from $10.31 billion a year prior. The declines reflected a drop in member spending and loan volumes, and a lower average discount rate versus the prior period. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were projecting $9.21 billion in revenue. Excluding the travel and entertainment categories, American Express saw card member spending that was 11% above what it was in the same period in 2019. In recent weeks, \"all categories of travel and entertainment spending in the U.S.\" have increased, Chief Executive Stephen Squeri said in a release. \"We view 2021 as a transition year, where we are focused on making investments to rebuild growth momentum in our core business,\" he continued.
