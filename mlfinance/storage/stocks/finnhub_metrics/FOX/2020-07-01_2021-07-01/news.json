While the blank-check company will focus on south and southeast Asia, India will be of a particular focus.Murdoch, who was previously chief executive officer of 21st Century Fox Inc., and Uday Shankar, the former president of Walt Disney Asia Pacific, are co-chairmen of the SPAC, the filing shows. The announcement confirmed a Bloomberg News report in February on the listing plans.Seven Islands plans to offer 30 million units at $10 apiece, with each unit comprised of one share and a fourth of a warrant. It is expected to list on Nasdaq under the symbol \u201cSVNI.\u201d Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and PJT Partners Inc. are advising the offering.The 48-year-old son of media tycoon Rupert Murdoch resigned from the board of News Corp. in July last year, citing differences of opinion with the publishing company.

The platform also provides sports betting information in the US and has an exclusive marketing partnership with Fox partner FanDuel, which acts as a funnel for sport betting leads. Fox Corp. Executive Chairman and CEO Lachlan Murdoch said, \u201cAs Fox further diversifies our growing digital portfolio and broadens our position in the sports wagering ecosystem, there could be no better acquisition than Outkick.\u201d (See Fox Corp stock analysis on TipRanks) Outkick Founder Clay Travis added, \u201cOutkick has grown out of my passion for producing bold, well-informed, and entertaining content about sports, current events, and, more recently, sports wagering. With the power of FOX behind us, we look forward to maintaining Outkick\u2019s unwavering commitment to that mission.\u201d Travis\u2019 sports radio show attracts 10 million monthly listeners and Outkick podcast network (launched in September 2020) garners over 4 million downloads of monthly episodes. Upon acquisition, Outkick will operate as an independent brand. Fox will distribute Outkick content across its current platforms. Fox Corp. reported results for 3Q 2021 on May 5. Owing to a drop in advertising sales, its revenue declined 6.7% year-on-year to $3.21 billion but came in ahead of consensus estimates by $60 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.88, beating analysts\u2019 estimates of $0.50. On May 6, Loop Capital Markets Analyst Alan Gould reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $50 (33.1% upside potential) from $36. Noting Fox\u2019s 3Q showing as \u201cStrong\u201d, Gould commented that the current market valuation for the stock does not fully incorporate the value of its gaming assets. Consensus among analysts is that Fox Corp. is a Moderate Buy based on 8 Buys, 6 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $41.54 implies 10.6% upside potential. Shares have gained about 50.8% over the past year.

Animation, an AT&T (NYSE: T) subsidiary, on the project, according to a report in Deadline. The series, called \u201cBedrock,\u201d takes place two decades after the conclusion of \u201cThe Flintstones\u201d and finds Fred on the cusp of retiring while his twentysomething daughter Pebbles is starting her own professional life. A pilot script is being written by Lindsay Kerns, author of \u201cJurassic World: Camp Cretaceous\u201d and \u201cDC Super Hero Girls.\u201d Banks will the voice actor for Pebbles and serve as executive producer. See Also: Money Mitch: Stocks With 10x Potential Benzinga Will It Work? \u201cThe Flintstones\u201d was a Hanna-Barbera production that gained notability as the first prime-time animated series, debuting on ABC in September 1960 and running for 166 episodes across five seasons. The success of the original show spawned films, spinoff series, television specials including a pair of Christmas productions \u2013 though it was never explained how the prehistoric characters were cognizant of the holiday celebrating the birth of Jesus \u2013 and a wave of merchandising including breakfast cereals and children\u2019s vitamins. Even Detroit Edison (NYSE: DTE) recognized the value of the animated characters by casting Fred and Wilma Flintstone in a 1977 educational film \u201cEnergy: A National Issue.\u201d Efforts to reboot \u201cThe Flintstones\u201d for a contemporary audience never took root. A 2001 Cartoon Network production \u201cThe Flintstones: On the Rocks\u201d was so poorly received that it was never broadcast again after its premiere. Seth McFarlane announced plans for his own version of \u201cThe Flintstones,\u201d but the project never got made. Nonetheless, Fox is voicing confidence that audiences will embrace an elderly Fred and grown-up Pebbles. \u201cLong before the Simpsons and Springfield, the Griffins and Quahog or even when the Belchers started serving burgers on Ocean Avenue, there were the Flintstones and Bedrock,\u201d said Michael Thorn, president for entertainment at Fox Entertainment. \u201cTheir imprint on the animation universe is undeniable and the idea of adapting it for today\u2019s audience is a challenge we here at Fox are very much looking forward to taking on with Warner Bros., Elizabeth and Lindsay. No pressure whatsoever, really.\u201d (Fred Flintstone (voiced by Alan Reed) meets Ann-Margrock (voiced by Ann-Margret) in \"The Flintstones.\" Photo courtesy of Cinema Crazed.)

FanDuel, which is owned by FTSE 100 bookmaker Flutter Entertainment, risks being taken off the air by FoxSports, America\u2019s second-biggest sports television network, The Sunday Telegraph has learnt. The threat comes at a time when advertising is playing a key role in allowing operators to grab a toehold in what is expected to be the world\u2019s biggest regulated market. If followed through, it would mark a significant escalation of a row that erupted last week between Fox Corporation and Flutter. Fox last week launched legal action in New York against Flutter, the operator behind Sky Bet, Paddy Power and Betfair, in a row over FanDuel, which has a 40pc share of the US market. Fox has an option to buy an 18.6pc stake in FanDuel in July. It claims it is entitled to pay the same price that Flutter paid in December, when the London-listed operator acquired the shares of FanDuel that it did not own at the time. But Flutter claims it must pay the \u201cfair market value\u201d in July and has alleged that Fox is trying to secure a \u201cwindfall\u201d by buying the shares at a lower price. One insider said that Fox\u2019s preference was to resolve the dispute. However, if it could not be resolved, Fox would focus on advertising its own brand, FoxBet, instead of promoting FanDuel. Sources close to Flutter claimed that Fox had realised it has backed the wrong horse.
