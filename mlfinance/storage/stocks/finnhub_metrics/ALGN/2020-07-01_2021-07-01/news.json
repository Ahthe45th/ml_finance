The Invisalign\u00ae Virtual Care solution enables remote communication between Invisalign doctors and their patients to track treatment progress. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, many Invisalign doctors around the world pieced together video calls, texts, and patient-submitted photos through a variety of platforms to help monitor patient progress, reduce in-office appointments, and ensure continuity of patient care during treatment. In response, Align Technology launched a set of digital tools to support doctors. These solutions included the Invisalign Virtual Care and Invisalign\u00ae Virtual Appointment tools that were built into the My Invisalign App. Invisalign Virtual Care can be used for remote consultations, assessment of treatment progress, and to communicate adjustments or concerns during treatment. Patients use the intuitive My Invisalign App to stay engaged in their treatment and convey progress photos to their doctor, who reviews these photos on their Invisalign Doctor Site and communicates any needed instructions to patients along their Invisalign treatment journey. The combined features of Invisalign Virtual Care can contribute to benefits such as less time spent in the treatment chair, and represents the next level in practice and care transformation, enabling doctors to remotely manage a range of practice services. \u201cCustomer feedback to date has been overwhelmingly positive and using Invisalign Virtual Care has shown to be a huge benefit, as many dentists and orthodontists are embracing digital treatment in new ways and more purposefully than ever before,\u201d said Raj Pudipeddi, chief innovation, product, and marketing officer and senior vice president, Align Technology. \u201cWinning this award from MedTech Breakthrough is a great honor and we are thrilled to be listed among the many other innovative winners this year.\u201d The mission of the MedTech Breakthrough Awards is to honor excellence and recognize the innovation, hard work and success in a range of health and medical technology categories, including Robotics, Clinical Administration, Telehealth, Patient Engagement, Electronic Health Records (EHR), mHealth, Medical Devices, Medical Data and many more.

We offer our sincere congratulations to the entire Align Technology team on a well-deserved 2021 MedTech Breakthrough Award win.\u201d Invisalign Virtual Care launched in March 2020 and is now available in more than 54 countries worldwide.

Commenting on Align's Q1'21 results, Align Technology President and CEO Joe Hogan said, \u201cI\u2019m pleased to report another strong quarter with record revenues and volumes reflecting strong growth for both Invisalign Clear Aligners and iTero Systems and Services across products and customer channels worldwide. Q1 sequential Invisalign Clear Aligner growth was driven by strength in both adult and teen market segments, across products and customer channels especially in North America and the EMEA region, led by UKI, Germany and France. The year is off to a great start \u2013 and Q1 reflects increasing momentum from continued investments in our strategic initiatives. During the quarter we reached a significant milestone with our 10 millionth Invisalign patient, Gabriela Silva, who recently began treatment with Dr. Eunice Blind, an Invisalign-trained orthodontist in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, one of our fastest growing country markets. It\u2019s remarkable to think about the pace of growth and adoption that we are experiencing worldwide, especially when considering it took 10 years to achieve our one millionth Invisalign patient milestone. Now we are adding one million new Invisalign patients in less than six months. We are grateful to our doctor partners and their patients, and to our 20,000 employees around the world who have helped us reach this milestone.\u201d Financial Summary - First Quarter Fiscal 2021 Q1'21Q4'20Q1'20Invisalign Case Shipments 595,820 567,950 359,440GAAP Net Revenues$894.8M$834.5M$551.0MClear Aligner$753.3M$700.7M$481.6MImaging Systems and CAD/CAM Services$141.5M$133.8M$69.4MNet Income$200.4M$159.0M$1,518.1MDiluted EPS$2.51$2.00$19.21Non-GAAPNet Income$198.4M$207.7M$57.9MDiluted EPS$2.49$2.61$0.73 As of March 31, 2021, Align had $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $960.8 million as of December 31, 2020. We also have $300 million available under a revolving line of credit. Under our May 2018 Repurchase Program, we have $100 million remaining available for repurchase of our common stock. Recent Announcements \u2013 April 2021: Align announced that over 10 million patients have begun treatment with the Invisalign system \u2013 the most advanced clear aligner system in the world \u2013 including 2.6 million teenage patients. Align is celebrating 10 million Invisalign smiles with 10 million thanks \u2013 donating $10 million to the Align Foundation, a donor-advised fund managed by Fidelity Charitable, to fund organizations that transform smiles and support and educate teens. Align hopes to inspire others to share their smiles using #10MInvisalignSmiles. This is a significant milestone for the company and the Invisalign-trained orthodontists and dentists worldwide who trust Invisalign clear aligners to treat adults, teens, and patients as young as 6 years old. The 10 millionth Invisalign patient milestone reflects accelerating pace of adoption of Invisalign treatment driven by continued global expansion and investments in digital technologies including the iTero intraoral scanner. The 10 millionth Invisalign patient is Gabriela Silva, who recently began treatment with Dr. Eunice Blind, an orthodontist practicing at Clinica Pedroso, in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Align is also partnering with Por 1 Sorriso, a Brazilian non-governmental organization (NGO) to help create even more smiles in socially vulnerable communities.Align Technology and DECA Dental Group announced that they have extended their relationship and have signed a new multi-year agreement for the Invisalign system through early 2025. In addition, DECA Dental Group is extending utilization of the iTero Element 5D imaging system across its affiliated practices in the U.S. This provides DECA Dental doctors and clinical support team members with access to Align\u2019s customized clinical education for the Invisalign system and the iTero Element 5D imaging system to support practices in adopting new workflows for restorative dentistry and for digital orthodontics.Align celebrated the 2 millionth Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) Invisalign System patient milestone in Q4\u201920 by announcing a consumer campaign featuring Puck, a 15-year-old student from the Netherlands. Since Invisalign treatment allows patients to continue with their lifestyle, including practicing contact sports, Puck can continue doing what she loves \u2013 a passion for boxing -- while being treated for a more beautiful smile. She is in treatment with Dr. Lotte Veldhuijzen van Zanten - an Invisalign trained orthodontist based in Zwolle, who prescribed Puck the Invisalign Comprehensive treatment for a deep bite correction. Puck will be featured in our 2 millionth EMEA patient campaign, which will run in the Netherlands and other select markets, and will include promotional activities, doctor communications, social activation, in-practice and digital activities.Align announced plans to open a new manufacturing facility in Poland to address the large and untapped market opportunity in the EMEA region, which represents over 5 million annual orthodontic case starts and more than 150 million EMEA consumers who can potentially benefit from a healthier, beautiful smile. The new Wroclaw plant will be Align\u2019s first in the EMEA region and its third aligner manufacturing plant worldwide, joining Juarez, Mexico and Ziyang, China. The new facility is expected to begin supplying customers in the EMEA region in early 2022. The investment is part of Align\u2019s strategy to bring its operational facilities closer to its customers. Align works directly with doctors - dentists and orthodontists - to provide them with the Invisalign system of clear aligners to prescribe to their patients to straighten their teeth and transform their smiles.Align announced its support to expand access to vaccinations by U.S. dentists. As seen over the last year, managing health care resources during a pandemic or other health crisis is a complex mix of preparation and execution, with access to responsible care being a key consideration. Federal, state, and local public health officials and health care providers have worked to balance access to COVID-19 testing and healthcare while also meeting other health needs \u2013 both routine and unexpected \u2013 that continue even during a pandemic. As the number of people vaccinated against COVID-19 increases across the U.S., it is important to review and build on lessons learned in order to optimize responsiveness for future events. One of those lessons is the potential value of using networks of existing, trusted, community-level health care providers when rolling out vaccination plans.

About Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"), we may provide investors with certain non-GAAP financial measures for gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses, income from operations, operating margin, interest income and other income (expense), net, net income before provision for (benefit from) income taxes, effective tax rate, net income and diluted net income per share, which exclude certain items that may not be indicative of our fundamental operating performance including discrete cash and non-cash charges or gains that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Non-GAAP measures will exclude the effects of stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, non-cash deferred tax assets and associated amortization related to the intra-entity transfer of non-inventory assets, acquisition-related costs, and arbitration award gain, and, if applicable, any associated tax impacts. We use non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our recurring core operating performance. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal evaluation of period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they will be provided to and used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the performance of our business. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures, though, because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our public disclosures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is meant to be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We urge investors to review the reconciliation of our GAAP financial measures to the comparable Non-GAAP financial measures included in this presentation and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned \"Unaudited GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation.\" About Align Technology, Inc.Align Technology designs and manufactures the Invisalign\u00ae system, the most advanced clear aligner system in the world, iTero\u00ae intraoral scanners and services, and exocad CAD/CAM software.

(Nasdaq: ALGN) today announced that over 10 million patients have begun treatment with the Invisalign system - the most advanced clear aligner system in the world \u2013 including 2.6 million teenage patients*. This is a significant milestone for the company and the Invisalign-trained orthodontists and dentists worldwide who trust Invisalign clear aligners to treat adults, teens, and patients as young as 6 years old. Commenting on the 10 millionth Invisalign patient milestone, Joe Hogan, Align Technology CEO, said, \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable to think about the pace of growth and adoption that we are experiencing worldwide, especially when considering it took 10 years to achieve our one millionth Invisalign patient milestone and now we are adding one million new Invisalign patients in less than six months. We are grateful to our doctor partners and their patients, and to our 20,000 employees around the world who have helped us reach this milestone. In recognition of our 10 millionth Invisalign milestone, we have donated $10 million to the Align Foundation donor-advised fund to support organizations whose visions tie closely to our own: transforming smiles and changing lives, supporting and educating teens, and empowering our doctor customers through partnerships with learning institutions and foundations. We are also kicking off a campaign called \u201c10 Million Smiles. 10 Million Thanks\u201d centered around the transformative power of Invisalign treatment through the eyes of Invisalign patients. This is our way to say thank you and inspire others to share their smiles with the world using #10MInvisalignSmiles.\u201d To join in the global celebration, tag yourself using #10MInvisalignSmiles on social media and share a smile selfie, story or video with the world. \u201cI\u2019m honored to be the 10 millionth Invisalign patient and very excited about improving my smile with Invisalign aligners,\u201d said Gabriela Silva, the 10 millionth Invisalign patient. \u201cAs part of my job, I\u2019m in front of people all the time and my smile and ability to communicate are very important to me. After searching for different options, I selected Invisalign treatment because I could improve my smile with minimal impact to the way I look or how I speak. My experience with Dr. Blind has been amazing so far and I know that she will be with me each step of the way. Dr. Blind has a very modern practice with a fun and experienced staff and lots of high-tech equipment. I was impressed that she was able to show me before and after Invisalign images using the iTero scanner which helped me visualize how my smile would look after treatment. I can\u2019t believe that in only eight months, I can get a brand new smile that will increase my self-confidence without disrupting my daily routine. Even my husband asks from time to time if I'm wearing my aligners or not. It's really funny coming from someone who knows me so well and sees me everyday!\u201d \u201cI was delighted to learn that my patient, Gabriela Silva, is the 10 millionth Invisalign patient,\u201d noted Dr. Eunice Blind. \u201cInvisalign treatment is totally revolutionary and the ability to anticipate the results and share visuals with patients before treatment has even started gets them really excited. When patients see a simulation of themselves and what can be achieved with Invisalign aligners, they get even more motivated to commit themselves to treatment \u2014 something that is not possible with traditional orthodontics. As an orthodontist practicing in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil for the past six years, I know first hand how digital technologies like the Invisalign system and the iTero scanner are revolutionizing orthodontics. These technologies have changed our clinic completely and took us once and for all to the flow of digital dentistry.\u201d In addition to the $10 million contribution to the Align Foundation, Align is partnering with Brazilian NGO Por 1 Sorriso (\u201cFor 1 Smile\u201d) to help create even more smiles by sponsoring their mission of better health and well-being through access to dental and medical care in underprivileged communities. As part of the sponsorship, Por 1 Sorriso will develop doctor-engaged events over the course of a year starting with an event on May 29 in S\u00e3o Paulo, with dental and medical assistance to homeless residents and the local community of S\u00e3o Paulo city. \u201cI am excited and proud to have Brazilians Gabriela Silva and Dr. Eunice Blind represent Align\u2019s 10 millionth Invisalign patient milestone,\u201d said Ritesh Sharma, Align vice president and general manager, Latin America. \u201cLatin America represents a tremendous growth potential for Align and celebrating this major milestone reflects the significant investments we have made in commercial operations, clinical education and training, and sales and marketing. At the same time, oral health and overall health conditions continue to be a challenge in certain regions across Latin America, especially in underserved areas. We are committed to making a difference in the communities where we work and live and we are inspired to be partnering with an organization like Por 1 Sorriso, that is dedicated to helping doctors improve the lives and smiles of people throughout Brazil.\u201d * Data on file at Align Technology, Q1, 2021. The Align FoundationLaunched in 2020, the Align Foundation provides a structured means by which significant donations are directed from a donor-advised fund overseen by Fidelity Charitable, with the flexibility to provide smaller monetary donations, processes to donate our products, as well as an organized way to involve our employees in giving activities.

WROCLAW, Poland and TEMPE, Ariz. and ROTKREUZ, Switzerland, April 22, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN), a leading global medical device company engaged in the design and manufacture of the Invisalign system, iTero intraoral scanners, and exocad CAD/CAM services for orthodontic and restorative dentistry, today announced plans to open a new manufacturing facility in Poland to address the large and underpenetrated market opportunity in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region, which represents over 5 million annual orthodontic case starts and more than 150 million EMEA consumers who can potentially benefit from a healthier, beautiful smile. The new Wroclaw plant will be Align\u2019s first in the EMEA region and its third plant worldwide, joining Juarez, Mexico and Ziyang, China. The new facility is expected to begin supplying customers in the EMEA region in early 2022. The investment is part of Align\u2019s strategy to bring its operational facilities closer to its customers. Align works directly with doctors - dentists and orthodontists - to provide them with the Invisalign system of clear aligners to prescribe to their patients to straighten their teeth and transform their smiles. \u201cI\u2019m excited to announce plans to open our first aligner manufacturing facility in the EMEA region, and third globally. This significant investment underscores our commitment to the more than 62,700 Invisalign trained doctors and their patients in the EMEA region and extends our local operations in the region that include treatment planning facilities (TREAT), based in Poland, Germany and Spain,\u201d said Emory Wright, Align senior vice president, Global Operations. Align Technology is the world\u2019s largest 3D printing manufacturer, with as many as 700,000 unique aligner parts produced per day in its manufacturing facilities across the globe. The Invisalign system is leveraged by over 200,000 Invisalign trained dentists and orthodontists. More than 9.6 million patients have been treated with the Invisalign system worldwide, including 2 million patients in the EMEA region as of the fourth quarter of 2020. \"We are proud to open Align\u2019s first manufacturing facility in the EMEA region. The state-of-the-art EMEA plant in Wroclaw is expected to add more than 2,500 jobs to Align by the end of 2025, making it the company\u2019s largest investment in EMEA to date. Align has been expanding its presence in the region for the past 20 years by adding new offices, building strong regional and local teams, and expanding digital treatment planning facilities in three different markets \u2013 with plans for further expansion. This new investment will allow us to deliver on our ongoing commitment to Invisalign doctors in the region to support them with more dedicated, customized support, as well as quicker turnaround and delivery times,\u201d added Markus Sebastian, Align senior vice president and managing director, EMEA. \u201cThe development of Polish industry, using innovative technologies, is one of the key priorities of the Polish government, which has been highlighted in the Industrial Development Policy of Poland. We continue to create the best possible conditions to allow development of domestic companies, as well as encourage foreign capital to invest in our country. We consistently support investment in digitalization. Poland has some of the world's best specialists in digitization and support instruments, such as dedicated economic zones or the government grant program that significantly simplify the procedure for business development. We are pleased that another investor - Align Technology, has recognized these opportunities and decided to expand their presence in the EMEA region by planning to open the largest 3D printing and manufacturing plants in Poland,\u201d said Polish Deputy Prime Minister Jaroslaw Gowin, Minister for Development, Labour and Technology. \u201cI am very pleased with Align Technology's decision to further develop its operations in Poland. The new project has a huge potential in terms of employment, with approximately 2,500 new jobs expected to be created. Digital transformation has changed the face of many industries and has found its place in the medical sector, which is best proved by Align, a company that uses 3D printing in production. It is worth emphasizing that the interest of the medical industry in the Polish market is still growing, as confirmed by inquiries of foreign companies coming to Polish Investment & Trade Agency (PAIH), with six medical investment projects and another five already underway. Technologies used in the medical sector are now very much needed by everyone,\u201d added Krzysztof Drynda, Chairman of the Polish Investment and Trade Agency. The new Align manufacturing facility will open in early 2022, with plans to support all EMEA Invisalign case shipments by 2024. The multi-million-dollar investment by Align is one of the larger projects by an international company in the greater Wroclaw area. *total number of doctors trained in EMEA since Dec. 1998.

About the Invisalign system Invisalign clear aligners are a removable and transparent teeth-straightening solution produced using digital and 3D technologies. This type of solution differs from other orthodontic devices in that they are more comfortable and can be easily removed for eating or drinking. Used to treat minor to complex types of malocclusions, Invisalign clear aligners are replaced every one or two weeks, depending on a doctor\u2019s recommendation, gradually moving teeth towards the projected final position.

(Nasdaq: ALGN), a leading global medical device company engaged in the design and manufacture of the Invisalign system, iTero intraoral scanners, and exocad CAD/CAM services for orthodontic and restorative dentistry, today announced its support to expand access to vaccinations by U.S. dentists. As seen over the last year, managing health care resources during a pandemic or other health crisis is a complex mix of preparation and execution, with access to responsible care being a key consideration. Federal, state, and local public health officials and health care providers have worked to balance access to COVID-19 testing and healthcare while also meeting other health needs \u2013 both routine and unexpected \u2013 that continue even during a pandemic. As the number of people vaccinated against COVID-19 increases across the U.S., it is important to review and build on lessons learned in order to optimize responsiveness for future events. One of those lessons is the potential value of using networks of existing, trusted, community-level health care providers when rolling out vaccination plans. \u201cSince the start of the pandemic, Align\u2019s customers \u2013 primarily dentists and orthodontists across the country \u2013 have been at the forefront of their profession and healthcare, in general, using social media and virtual appointment and treatment monitoring tools to stay connected with and communicate public health and safety protocols to their patients,\u201d said Julie Coletti, Align Technology senior vice president, chief legal and regulatory officer. \u201cAs essential health care providers of ongoing health care services, they have earned their patients\u2019 trust by staying current with the latest health and safety protocols and public health requirements to safely and responsibly treat their patients.\u201d As trusted, highly qualified health care professionals, dentists can expand the number of care providers that offer immunizations. According to the American Dental Association, 9 percent of Americans (31 million people) see a dentist every year, but do not see a physician1. This is a significant statistic to be considered as part of any future plans for vaccine administration. Dentists Provide Experienced Care Before completing dental school and becoming licensed, dentists are professionally trained to administer intraoral and extraoral injections into nerve tissue for local anesthesia \u2013 which is arguably more difficult to effectively administer than a vaccine injected into the shoulder muscle. Further, many states permit dentists to administer dermal fillers, Botox\u00ae injections, and to start IVs for procedures requiring sedation. Building on Pandemic Policies A majority of states have established the foundation for dentist-provided vaccinations by affirmatively permitting dentists to administer COVID-19 vaccinations. On March 16, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services amended an emergency declaration under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act to authorize additional providers, including dentists and dental students, to vaccinate patients for COVID-19 nationwide regardless of state laws that prevent dentists from doing so.3 Align believes that these recent pandemic-related policies should be the start of additional integration of dentists to vaccinate against other diseases. For example, augmenting the role of the dental profession in routine immunization of oral health related diseases such as Human Papillomavirus (HPV) would increase society\u2019s access to future immunizations.2 Such steps would establish a more robust vaccine program by expanding access at a community level through trusted and competent dentists. 1 ADA Health Policy Institute, \u201cCould Dentists Relieve Physician Shortages, Manage Chronic Disease?\u201d, David Leader, D.M.D., M.P.H.; Marko Vujicic, Ph.D.; Brittany Harrison, M.A.; http://www.ada.org/~/media/ADA/Science%20and%20Research/HPI/Files/HPIBrief_1218_1.pdf 2 North Carolina Oral Health Collaborative (NCOHC), \u201cDentists\u2019 Role in Vaccination: An Opportunity for Public Health Impact\u201d, Zachary Brian, DMD, MHA, https://oralhealthnc.org/dentists-role-in-vaccination-an-opportunity-for-public-health-impact/ 3 https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/03/16/2021-05401/seventh-amendment-to-declaration-under-the-public-readiness-and-emergency-preparedness-act-for About Align Technology, Inc.Align Technology designs, manufactures and offers the Invisalign\u00ae system, the most advanced clear aligner system in the world, iTero\u00ae intraoral scanners and services, and exocad CAD/CAM software.
