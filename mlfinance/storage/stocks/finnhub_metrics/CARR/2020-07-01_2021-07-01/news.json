Pre-pandemic, assuming it worked, probably never. Today? Probably a lot. And\u00a0even once the coronavirus outbreaks have subsided and a vaccine is finally in hand, you\u2019re probably\u00a0still going to feel differently about the air you\u00a0breathe, especially indoors.Increased interest in filtration, disinfection and other tools for\u00a0improving\u00a0the quality of indoor air will likely create a new revenue opportunity of multiple billions of dollars across the industry, Johnson Controls International Plc CEO George Oliver said on a call Tuesday to discuss the building-products company\u2019s most recent quarterly results. Johnson Controls alone is looking at potential\u00a0projects in this vein worth \u201ca couple of hundred million\u201d for just next year, he said. That echoes commentary from rivals including Carrier Global Corp., which\u00a0estimates\u00a0the ultimate market for indoor air-quality improvements will\u00a0reach\u00a0about $10 billion, including\u00a0$150 million of potential business opportunities the company has already identified for itself. Honeywell International Inc. cited a more than\u00a0$600 million sales pipeline for its \u201chealthy buildings\u201d offerings.\u00a0It\u2019s in these companies\u2019 interest to tout this opportunity. Heating, ventilation and air conditioner (HVAC) systems have been a rare bright spot in an industrial sector that\u2019s struggled to inspire investors with third-quarter results that signaled\u00a0a\u00a0sure\u00a0but slow\u00a0recovery. Consumers have been snapping up new air conditioners amid a lockdown-inspired home-improvement wave, but even commercial landlords\u00a0are\u00a0investing at a greater rate than expected as they try to lure people\u00a0back to offices, restaurants and retail space.\u00a0There were fears that air conditioners were to blame for spikes in coronavirus cases as hot summer weather pushed people indoors. The reality is that these systems can be an effective tool in fighting off contagions \u2014 with some upgrades. These range from adding higher levels of filtration and allowing for more outside air flow to installing ultraviolet\u00a0light disinfectant systems and digital-monitoring technology that lets building managers know if everything is working as it should. All of these cost money.\u00a0\u201cIt's something that everybody needs,\u201d Honeywell CEO Darius Adamczyk said on a call to discuss third-quarter results last week.\u00a0\u201cAt least in the U.S. and some other parts of the world, people are not working in their workplace yet. But when they do come back, they do want to come back to a healthier environment. I think we're kind of hitting the spot there and the time to implement those solutions is now, not after people come back.\u201dCarrier CEO Dave Gitlin pointed out that people spend a whopping 90% of their lives indoors on average, meaning that if you are 50 years old, you\u2019ve spent 45 years\u00a0sitting inside. That is both\u00a0depressing and instructive. We may be more aware of our time inside after having endured\u00a0lockdowns, but even in a pandemic-free future we\u2019re still going to be breathing in an awful lot of indoor air. And it seems likely that after everything the world has been through, the average person is at least going to think twice about the quality of that air.\u00a0This theme\u00a0fits hand in hand with a broader pivot toward sustainability in both the HVAC industry in particular and the manufacturing economy more broadly. A building that\u2019s helping the environment by releasing fewer greenhouse gases doesn\u2019t have the same appeal if the air within its four walls can be a (real or perceived) conduit for disease. What we\u2019ve learned is that our previous standards of air purification didn\u2019t hold up to the test of the pandemic and those need to evolve accordingly, Oliver of Johnson Controls said.

Raytheon reiterated its expectation that global air traffic won\u2019t return to 2019 levels until at least 2023 \u2014\u00a0and that\u2019s assuming the successful development and broad distribution of a coronavirus vaccine. \u201cIt's clearly not a V, all right?\u00a0This is going to be a long, slow recovery,\u201d Raytheon Chief Executive Officer Greg Hayes said on a call with analysts to discuss the results. \u201cWe continue to\u00a0focus\u00a0on what we can control.\u201d\u00a0That\u00a0means building on expected cost savings from the merger between United Technologies Corp. and Raytheon Co. completed earlier this year. And then some.\u00a0The company had previously planned to consolidate its office space in light of the combination and was targeting a 10% reduction in\u00a0its 31 million square feet of real estate. But after touring facilities where only a handful of people are now\u00a0on-site and the rest\u00a0are diligently (and productively) working remotely, Hayes came to the conclusion that \u201cwe don\u2019t need all this space.\u201d Raytheon\u00a0now plans to double its previous goal and ultimately get rid of as much as 25% of its office square footage, starting with locations it currently leases.\u00a0Hayes\u00a0probably isn\u2019t\u00a0the only\u00a0executive to wonder if the\u00a0pandemic-driven work-from-home revolution offers an opportunity for cost savings, but this shift feels more meaningful coming from a company that used to sell quite a lot of products to the commercial real estate market.\u00a0In conjunction with the Raytheon merger, the former United Technologies also spun off its\u00a0Otis Worldwide Corp. elevator unit and the Carrier Global Corp. heating and air conditioner division. Those businesses\u00a0will suffer if more companies follow Raytheon\u2019s lead\u00a0and decide they, too, can function with significantly less\u00a0office space.Raytheon is also planning to consolidate some of its manufacturing real estate in\u00a0lower-cost locations and reimagining\u00a0what those factories\u00a0should look like on the inside. The company highlighted a new turbine airfoil facility for its Pratt & Whitney jet-engine division that will be based in Asheville, North Carolina, and will combine work that\u2019s now spread across multiple sites and throughout the supply chain. North Carolina\u2019s\u00a0flat corporate income\u00a0tax rate of 2.5% is the lowest in the country among states that apply a levy, compared with a top marginal rate of 8% in Raytheon\u2019s home state of Massachusetts, according to the right-leaning Tax Foundation. This new facility in North Carolina will be \u201chighly automated,\u201d and\u00a0Raytheon expects to achieve $175 million in annual cost savings.\u00a0There\u2019s been a lot of talk about a potential resurgence in\u00a0U.S. manufacturing in the wake of the pandemic, whether that\u2019s due to companies growing disillusioned with the benefits of far-flung supply chains and relocating facilities back home\u00a0or the prospects of a major infrastructure spending push by the government. Raytheon\u2019s commentary on Tuesday underscores why the jobs component of these initiatives is far from straightforward. As I\u2019ve written, companies are going to be reluctant to give up the\u00a0cost cuts they achieved in the pandemic, and it\u2019s likely that many of the jobs eliminated during the peak of the disruption might never come back.\u00a0A \u201creshoring\u201d of manufacturing work from China to the U.S. \u2014\u00a0to the extent it actually happens \u2014 seems more likely to spark a golden age for automation.To that end,\u00a0Raytheon said Tuesday that only about half of the 15,000 jobs being cut from its commercial aerospace businesses would\u00a0return once demand eventually recovers. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep the other 50% from coming back, and that's what's going to give us leverage on the upside when we do indeed\u00a0see a return to normalcy in air traffic,\u201d Hayes said. Much of the reduction will come from eliminating layers of management and overlap in centralized functions like procurement. \u201cIt should lead to, long term, a much more efficient organization,\u201d he added.\u00a0All in, Raytheon is eliminating roughly 20,000 jobs this year, including\u00a04,000\u00a0contractor positions and 1,000 previously expected adjustments because of\u00a0the merger. And this is coming from a company that had\u00a0$10\u00a0billion of cash on its balance sheet at the end of the third quarter and sees the current crisis as an opportunity to invest in next-generation technology and gain more market share. \u201cYou have to invest for the long term,\u201d Hayes said. Indeed, just not in people or office space, apparently.\u00a0This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

After the option alert, the stock price moved up to $32.93.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-10-16  * Strike Price: $32.00  * Volume: 336  * Open Interest: 780Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it.Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.\"Out of the money\" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. \"Out of the money\" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.Understanding Sentiment Options are \"bullish\" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are \"bearish\" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Options Trades For This Crazy Market: Get Benzinga Options to Follow High-Conviction Trade Ideas  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For October 13, 2020  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Monday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Weight Watchers, Pools and Cereal", "id": 41323281, "image": "", "related": "CARR", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- One of the more striking features of the pandemic is the inequity of the pain it has inflicted. It\u00a0has disproportionately affected Black and Latino communities. More than 16 million Americans are unemployed, nearly triple February\u2019s levels, but investors in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index are back in the green for the year. And while some businesses are looking at a multiyear slump in demand, others are experiencing\u00a0their best sales growth ever. The second-quarter earnings season brought fresh evidence of relative bright spots for spending, from the obvious demand for cleaning products to more surprising splurges like swimming pools and Weight Watchers memberships. That\u2019s a shift from the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009.\u00a0You\u00a0would be hard pressed to name large companies that didn\u2019t experience some\u00a0sort of a slowdown\u00a0from\u00a0that particular recession, let alone any that were outright beneficiaries. There are no real winners in a global pandemic that has killed more than 150,000 people in the U.S., but the willingness of at least some Americans to keep spending on certain categories is a positive indicator and has most likely served to keep the\u00a0economic downturn from being even worse. Here\u2019s what stood out:BIG-TICKET ITEMSThe unique nature of the pandemic and months spent under lockdown conditions has some consumers making the kind of large\u00a0discretionary purchases that are typically the first to get cut in a downturn.\u00a0New-home sales in the U.S. rose to an almost 13-year high in June, while purchases of existing homes posted the largest ever month-over-month gain as families juggling\u00a0the work-from-home and virtual-learning experiments seek out bigger properties in less-urban areas. Much of this home-buying now starts virtually.\u00a0That translated into a 12% gain in\u00a0monthly users on\u00a0Zillow Group Inc.\u2019s sites during the second quarter.\u00a0Better-than-expected sales growth in its internet and mortgages divisions should push the company\u2019s third-quarter operating profit above the threshold it was targeting internally before the pandemic, Chief Financial Officer\u00a0Allen Parker said on an earnings call last week. High on the list of priorities for some home shoppers is going to be\u00a0a parking spot. A\u00a0wariness of public transportation and ride-sharing\u00a0has underscored the appeal of individual cars and helped the sector bounce back much more quickly than anticipated. General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. both reported better-than-expected second-quarter results amid a strong gain\u00a0in sales once dealerships and plants were allowed to reopen in May and June. Both could\u00a0return to profitability next quarter, a sharp contrast to the financial crisis when\u00a0GM\u00a0and Chrysler were forced into bankruptcy and Ford only barely avoided the same fate.\u00a0OUTDOOR LIVING\u00a0\u00a0The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0says outdoor activities are less risky than indoor ones,\u00a0and many people are growing tired of being cooped up at home.\u00a0No wonder RV-maker Thor Industries Inc. cited an \u201cinflux\u201d of first-time buyers. Camping World Holdings Inc.\u00a0said this month that demand had remained strong through the summer months and that it might be on track for its most profitable year ever.\u00a0Yeti Holdings Inc. posted an 18% increase in second-quarter sales\u00a0for\u00a0the division that includes its luxury\u00a0coolers, waterproof backpacks and fancy camping chairs.\u00a0If you can\u2019t drive your RV to the beach or a campsite on a lake, the next best option is to create your own personal waterfront oasis. Pool Corp., a distributor of parts and supplies, reported record sales in the second quarter and increased its earnings guidance for 2020. Pool filled most of that demand from existing inventory, but the revenue boom will eventually make its way to Pentair Plc, which makes\u00a0pool pumps, cleaners and automated control systems. Orders are up for both new pool construction and remodels, CEO\u00a0John Stauch said on the company\u2019s earnings call last month. With most new pools taking several quarters to complete, that\u2019s not the kind of investment that\u2019s made lightly and not one that\u2019s common in economic slumps. Global sales of pool equipment at Pentair fell 45% in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, for example.\u00a0HOME IMPROVEMENTSadly, a pool remains out of reach for most people. But it\u2019s also seemingly a\u00a0good time to do something about that cabinet that has never closed properly, replace that appliance that\u2019s making ominous noises or build that new deck.\u00a0Stanley Black & Decker Inc. rode the do-it-yourself wave to 8% organic sales growth in its tools segment in June and July, compared with the year-earlier periods.\u00a0Whirlpool Corp. said revenue declines in 2020 wouldn\u2019t be as bad as previously thought, as an initial spike in demand for extra refrigerators and freezers to store all that food people were stockpiling gave way to other upgrades in the kitchen, such as\u00a0ovens. HVAC systems have been another spending hot spot\u00a0because a broken air conditioner makes spending 24/7 inside a home even more of a challenge. Proper ventilation is also a critical\u00a0tool for combating the coronavirus. Orders for residential HVAC systems were up 100% in June compared with those in the month a year earlier and trending up more than 50%\u00a0in July at Carrier Global Corp., with similar spikes at rivals Trane Technologies Plc and Johnson Controls International Plc. People are also paying closer attention to their yards.\u00a0Scotts Miracle-Gro Co.\u2019s\u00a0revenue surged 28% in the quarter ended June 27,\u00a0thanks to robust demand for\u00a0gardening and lawn-care products.\u00a0The sales surge prompted the company to raise its full-year earnings outlook.SELF-IMPROVEMENTOther Americans have apparently made a project of themselves. Rosetta Stone Inc. reported a 92% increase in bookings from a year earlier in its consumer language segment\u00a0as people decided to use time stuck at home to learn Spanish or brush up on their Italian.\u00a0That uptake, coupled with increased sales of its literacy products for K-12 students, led the company to boost full-year sales guidance. Rosetta Stone is reportedly looking to capitalize on the demand boom with a potential sale.\u00a0Meanwhile, WW International Inc., the company behind Weight Watchers, notched 5 million subscribers in the second quarter \u2014\u00a0a count that was about even with the first quarter, the period that is typically peak season thanks to New Year\u2019s resolutions. The pandemic is prompting a \u201cradical re-appraisal\u201d of life and work in which \u201chealth and wellness is definitely moving from what I would think of prior as a luxury to a necessity,\u201d CEO Mindy Grossman said at a recent conference. WW\u2019s quarterly revenue fell from a year earlier, as many of its brick-and-mortar studios were temporarily closed because of the pandemic. But digital subscriptions \u2014\u00a0a more profitable model that the company is trying to pivot toward anyway \u2014\u00a0rose 23%.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CONSTANT CLEANINGThe pandemic has put hygiene and sanitization into sharp focus. That has shown up in obvious ways, such as a 22% surge in sales for Clorox Co. in the second quarter and a 19% increase in sales of 3M Co.\u2019s personal-protective gear, including N95 masks.\u00a0Cintas Corp. is known for its corporate uniforms, but it also helps supply companies with items like hand-sanitizer and masks. Sales for the unit that houses this business grew 22% in the most recent quarter on an organic basis, with demand for safety products more than making up for a decline in the restocking of office first-aid cabinets. It\u2019s not just disinfectants, though. With people spending so many more hours at home, the dishes are piling up more frequently and the floors are becoming grimy faster. That helped power sales of\u00a0Procter & Gamble Co.\u2019s\u00a0Dawn dish soap and Swiffer brands in the quarter, which contributed to a 14% increase in organic sales\u00a0in the company\u2019s fabric and\u00a0home care division.\u00a0Colgate-Palmolive Co., too, said it was struggling to keep up with sustained demand for dish soap.\u00a0Reynolds Consumer Products Inc.\u00a0recorded a double-digit\u00a0increase in sales in its Hefty\u00a0waste and storage bags unit as people generate more trash at home. Americans are also reluctant to share homes that may already feel a bit crowded with bugs and other pests. Rollins Inc., a pest-control company that operates under the Orkin brand among others, said it had outpaced its previous 10\u00a0best sales days during the second quarter and the month of July, largely through inbound call volume.\u00a0IN THE KITCHEN\u00a0Americans have been eating more meals and snacks at home amid widespread teleworking and safety concerns about visiting restaurants. The chaos of the outside world also has many people reaching for comfort food. Demand for previously forsaken goods like cereal and frozen foods is lifting sales at companies such as\u00a0Kellogg Co., which raised its guidance for the full year.\u00a0Newell Brands Inc., the company behind Crock-Pots and Calphalon nonstick pans, said sales at U.S. retailers of its appliances and cookware products were up \u201cdouble-digits\u201d from a year ago.\u00a0The stay-at-home lifestyle and a reluctance to venture into grocery stores has also benefited meal-kit maker\u00a0HelloFresh SE, which increased its ranks of global active customers to 4.2 million in the most recent quarter, up from 2.4\u00a0million a year earlier.
