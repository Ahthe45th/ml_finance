Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Cintas has. Cintas's Debt According to the Cintas's most recent financial statement as reported on January 8, 2021, total debt is at $2.54 billion, with $2.29 billion in long-term debt and $249.87 million in current debt. Adjusting for $703.17 million in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $1.84 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Cintas has $8.45 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.3. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and normal for another. Why Shareholders Look At Debt? Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

Cintas (CTAS) reported 3Q earnings of $2.37 per share, up 9.7% on a year-over-year basis, and handily beat the Street estimates of $2.21 per share. Revenue inched down 1.7% to $1.78 billion but topped analysts\u2019 expectations of $1.75 billion. The organic revenue growth rate for the quarter was flat. Additionally, the uniform rental and facility services operating segment also reported flat growth, while first aid and safety services operating segment revenues surged 17.7%. (See Cintas stock analysis on TipRanks) Cintas CEO Scott D.

That\u2019s particularly true in a pandemic, when the state of play changes at an ever-faster clip. With a surge in coronavirus cases in the U.S. Sun Belt and burgeoning concerns about a second wave in Europe and parts of Asia, any glimmers of insight from companies who operate on the ground floor of the economy carry extra weight.\u00a0Nearly five\u00a0months into this pandemic, CEOs in the manufacturing sector appear to at least have a handle on what\u2019s happening with their businesses, for better or for worse. Tuesday brought results from three companies that sit at key fault lines in the industrial economy: 3M Co., Rockwell Automation Inc. and Raytheon Technologies Corp.\u00a0Here are my top takeaways:\u00a03M Co. :\u00a0The maker of N95 masks has been on the front line\u00a0of the pandemic, but even in normal recessions, it\u2019s usually one of the first companies to see the early signs of a recovery, given the fast turnaround time for many of its products. So it\u2019s particularly encouraging that 3M says it\u2019s actually seeing July sales trending up by a low-single digit percentage\u00a0compared to a year earlier. That compares with a 13.1% decline on an organic basis in the second quarter that was slightly worse that what analysts had been anticipating, one possible reason for the stock\u2019s slide on the news. The forward trajectory is all that really matters at this point, though. Sales of N95 masks and other protective gear have\u00a0undoubtedly been one big driver of the\u00a0growth in July, with 3M on track to make two\u00a0billion of the respirators this year. But other companies including Fastenal Co. and Cintas Corp. have predicted a moderation of the surge-style spikes seen in the earlier days of the pandemic in April and May as the market is now comparably better-supplied. More importantly, for\u00a0those seeking\u00a0signs of economic revival, 3M cited\u00a0\u201cbroad-based sales improvements across businesses and geographies.\u201d While this doesn\u2019t necessarily augur a\u00a0V-shaped recovery for the manufacturing sector, it does suggest\u00a0things are moving in the right direction. The cloud over any rebound for 3M is its potential liabilities related to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which have been linked to cancer and other ailments. 3M reached an agreement last week with Alabama that will see it\u00a0assess contamination from the so-called forever chemicals;\u00a0invest in treatment and remediation; and research the substances impact on health and the environment \u2014 at an unspecified cost to the company. Some analysts had been expecting 3M to take another significant charge on PFAS in the second quarter and the missed opportunity to \u201ckitchen-sink\u201d what were going to be ugly numbers anyway may also be a factor in the stock reaction.\u00a0Rockwell Automation Inc.:\u00a0Continuing with the theme of possible green shoots of recovery, Rockwell CEO Blake Moret is confident enough in the trajectory of his company\u2019s recovery that he announced intentions to\u00a0roll back temporary pay cuts for employees by December and\u00a0\u201chopefully sooner.\u201d Rockwell also intends to make another\u00a0\u201crecognition payment\u201d to manufacturing workers who have continued to come in to factories\u00a0and kept its operations grinding along. While some companies have had to turn furloughs into permanent job cuts as the pandemic and associated economic slump have dragged on longer than expected, this is an important counterpoint. It speaks to a broader trend across the industrial landscape of companies prioritizing\u00a0labor and seeking cost\u00a0cuts elsewhere first in recognition of the unique nature of this particular downturn and shifting expectations of the corporate world\u2019s duty to the community.\u00a0Railroads CSX Corp. and Union Pacific Corp. have also said they are bringing workers off of furlough as volumes rebound. In terms of numbers, Rockwell actually increased its fiscal 2020 profit guidance for the year and now anticipates adjusted earnings per share of $7.40 to $7.60 on an organic sales decline of about 8%. This is based on an expectation that a \u201cgradual recovery continues, with no increase in pandemic-related facility closures or disruptions to the supply chain.\u201d Coming out of this crisis, Rockwell is set to be a key beneficiary of any significant push to bring manufacturing work back to North America.\u00a0Raytheon Technologies Corp. :\u00a0Whatever recovery is happening in manufacturing, it isn\u2019t showing up\u00a0in the world of commercial aerospace, with flight travel still at a crawl.\u00a0Raytheon \u2014\u00a0formed earlier this year from the merger of United Technologies Corp. and Raytheon Co. \u2014\u00a0burned through nearly $250 million of cash in the first quarter as stable results from its defense businesses failed to offset a disastrous slump in the aerospace operations. The Collins Aerospace parts division, previously the company\u2019s most profitable, was barely in the green on an adjusted basis in the second quarter and\u00a0Raytheon took a $3.2 billion goodwill writedown on the roughly $30 billion acquisition of Rockwell Collins Inc. in 2018 that helped form the unit. The charge reflects the deteriorating outlook for commercial aerospace due to the coronavirus, which no one could have predicted, but it\u2019s worth remembering that the deal was very expensive from the start and the assumptions underpinning\u00a0that price tag relied on quite a lot of things breaking the company\u2019s way.\u00a0The Pratt & Whitney engine segment saw sales tumble more than 30% excluding the impact of M&A and currency swings. Raytheon CEO Greg Hayes said the company had cut 8,000 positions in its commercial aerospace divisions and said some of that reduction would be permanent, a shift from the first quarter when he warned about cutting too deep. Arguably, things could have been uglier. The question now is whether the worst is truly behind the company. A slide in the earnings presentation termed \u201cCurrent Environment\u201d has big question marks next to projections for commercial air traffic and macroeconomic conditions. In case it wasn\u2019t clear what those meant, they are also colored gray, as in this is a gray area.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.
