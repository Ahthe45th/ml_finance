The facilities, which will eventually number about 1,500, will bring products closer to customers, making shopping online about as fast as a quick run to the store. It will also\u00a0help the world\u2019s largest e-commerce company take on a resurgent Walmart Inc.Amazon couldn\u2019t fulfill\u00a0its two-day delivery pledge earlier this year when shoppers in Covid-19 lockdown flooded the company with more orders than it could handle. While delivery times have improved\u00a0thanks to the hiring of\u00a0175,000 new workers, Amazon is now consumed with honoring a pre-pandemic pledge to get many products to Prime subscribers on the same day. So with the holidays approaching, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos is doubling down by investing billions in proximity, putting warehouses and swarms of blue vans in neighborhoods long populated with car dealerships, fast-food joints, shopping malls and big-box stores.Historically, Amazon gnawed away at brick-and-mortar rivals from warehouses on the exurban fringes, where it operated mostly out of sight and out of mind. That worked fine when the company was promising to get products to customers in two days. Now Walmart\u00a0and Target Corp. are using their thousands of stores to beat Amazon at its own game by offering same-day delivery of online orders. Walmart also recently started is own Prime-style subscription service, upping the competitive ante.A recently opened warehouse in Holyoke, Massachusetts, exemplifies\u00a0Amazon\u2019s answer to this existential challenge. Located not\u00a0far from a once vibrant mall, it\u2019s\u00a0just a short drive from more\u00a0than 600,000 people. The goal is to creep closer to\u00a0almost everyone in the U.S.\u00a0Beyond Amazon\u2019s retail rivals, the mass opening of small, quick-delivery warehouses poses a significant threat to United Parcel Service Inc. and the U.S. Postal Service. Being fastest in the online delivery race is so critical to Amazon\u2019s business that it doesn\u2019t trust the job to anyone else and is pulling back from these long-time delivery partners. Amazon is basically duplicating\u00a0UPS\u2019s logistics operation. Many of Amazon\u2019s new hubs\u00a0are within walking distance of UPS facilities.\u201cIn just a few years, Amazon has built its own UPS,\u201d says Marc Wulfraat, president of the logistics consulting firm MWPVL International Inc.,\u00a0who estimates Amazon will deliver 67% of its own packages this year and increase that to 85%. \u201cAmazon keeps spreading itself around the country, and as it does, its reliance on UPS will go away.\u201dAmazon shares were up less than 1% at 9:37\u00a0a.m. on Wednesday and have gained about 70% this year.\u00a0The company declined to comment on the expansion plans, but has said its last-mile delivery efforts are meant to supplement, not replace, its long-time partners. \u201cOur dedicated last-mile delivery network just delivered its 10 billionth package since launching over five years ago, and we\u2019re proud to provide a great service for our customers,\u201d\u00a0a spokeswoman said.\u00a0The company\u2019s appetite for real estate is so strong that many analysts have speculated that Amazon would convert vacant department stores\u00a0into distribution centers. In fact, that option is only a last resort, said the people privy to the company\u2019s plans, who requested anonymity to discuss an internal matter.Department stores such as J.C. Penney are often two stories and lack sufficient loading capacity, they said, meaning they require extensive remodeling to accommodate an Amazon delivery hub. Moreover, mall leases with existing tenants often prohibit the owner from introducing a delivery hub that could spoil the shopping experience, and city officials might not quickly approve an industrial use in a retail area. It\u2019s more likely that dead malls\u00a0will be bulldozed to make way for an Amazon warehouse, as they have in\u00a0the Midwest, than for an Amazon delivery station to sprout in a half-vacant mall\u00a0to coexist with Kay Jewelers and Cinnabon.Still, analysts expect underutilized retail space to make way for more e-commerce delivery stations due to rising\u00a0rents for industrial space, along with a surge in store vacancies. \u201cAny time you see retail being occupied by non-traditional retail uses, they\u2019re just holding off what\u2019s inevitable,\u201d\u00a0says Rick Stein, principal at Urban Decision\u00a0Group, who estimates the U.S. has 50% more retail real estate than it needs. \u201cIt\u2019s a Band-Aid, and at some point that mall is coming down.\u201dIn the past three years, 13.8\u00a0million square feet of retail space has been converted to 15.5 million square feet of industrial space, including vacant shopping malls\u00a0razed to make room for new warehouses, according to a July report by the commercial real estate firm CBRE Group Inc. That trend will continue\u00a0but not quickly enough for Amazon, which is building new facilities and moving into existing warehouses where it\u2019s faster to get a hub up and running.Amazon usually\u00a0puts new delivery stations\u00a0inside existing warehouses or signs long-term leases with development firms like\u00a0ProLogis Inc. to build them to its exacting specifications. Typical delivery stations are about\u00a0200,000 square feet\u2014about one-fourth\u00a0the size of one of the company\u2019s giant fulfillment centers\u2014with large lots where workers can park their personal vehicles and Amazon can stage delivery vans. About 20 tractor-trailers\u00a0arrive each night to drop off packages, which are loaded into hundreds of vans each morning before drivers fan out to make their rounds. In the afternoons, hundreds more Amazon Flex drivers, who use their own cars, arrive to deliver whatever\u2019s left. A typical hub can generate more than 1,000 vehicle trips each day, often in areas where roads are already congested.The surge in online shopping creates challenges for cities that still plan for growth and transportation needs based on people shopping at stores. They\u2019ll have to make more room close to residential areas for warehouses with big parking lots that generate a lot of traffic, creating inevitable clashes with local residents who want things delivered to their homes but don\u2019t want to have to look at a delivery station or get stuck in traffic behind a convoy of Amazon vans.\u201cRegulation is definitely flat-footed right now,\u201d says Nico Larco, an architecture professor at the University of Oregon, who studies urban land use. \u201cThe warehouse doesn\u2019t want to be tucked away in an industrial district any more. It wants to be right next to you. But when these things come to our neighborhoods, they\u2019re unsightly.\u201dNIMBY wars haven\u2019t slowed down Amazon so far. The company is opening three facilities in Kearny, New Jersey, this year, among more than a dozen slated for\u00a0the Garden State. The small township near Newark airport offers proximity to shoppers in the New York suburbs and is less than 10 miles from\u00a0Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side, making it a prime location. Mayor Alberto Santos has noticed a \u201cweird gentrification process for warehousing\u201d since Amazon came to town, with rents skyrocketing.\u201cThey don\u2019t stop at one,\u201d Santos says of Amazon. \u201cThey keep picking up sites, which drives up prices for everyone else. Kearny is one of those locations that had large warehouse and small warehouse users. This could crowd out that small user that has to find an alternative further away.\u201dBack in Holyoke, planning board member Eileen Regan says Amazon\u2019s delivery station prompted some concerns about traffic from nearby residents but\u00a0didn\u2019t face significant opposition. The company staggered shifts to keep delivery vans off roads during peak travel times, which is also in Amazon\u2019s interest, she says. Initially, Regan worried that traffic from both Amazon and the mall during the holidays could clog streets, but Covid-19 will likely keep shoppers at home, leaving more room for those Amazon vans.\u201cI\u2019m glad Amazon is there because so many retail facilities have gone under during this pandemic,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m glad that we have them to keep things running.\u201d\u00a0For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3c26ef500ecc28ea34516a7ff95b2bae197b4914f9b306d0fa6cf83698283a09"}, {"category": "company news", "datetime": 1600216959, "headline": "Here is What Hedge Funds Think About CBRE Group, Inc.
