The leading neurologist oversees 1,000+ Alzheimer's patients at his South U.S. center and has taken part in 30-40 trials including BIIB's EMERGE study and Roche\u2019s trials.\n\n\n\nYee outlined the conversation\u2019s key takeaways: \u201c(1) he has 100-200 patients already w/ known positive Abeta+ status from prior PET or other trial screening who could consider the drug already; (2) his center is comfortable to prescribe Aduhelm primarily to Abeta+ patients similar to the Phase III (mild, etc), (3) he thinks 100 patients could be on drug within 12 months, (4) reimbursement and other details need to get worked out but he doesn't foresee any major issues.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe expert reckons, that given the mixed efficacy data and the anticipated ARIA (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities) side effects, many physicians \u201cmay be apprehensive to prescribe the drug,\u201d although the demand will at first mostly come from neurologists who are \u201calready comfortable in looking at MRI scans to assess ARIA.\u201d\n\n\n\nPatient-wise, the KOL says there is awareness of the treatment\u2019s approval and patients have shown interest and are \u201cconsidering\u201d the new drug. The risk/benefit conversation and the doctor\u2019s opinion are most likely to be the determining factors in a patient\u2019s perception of Aduhelm.\n\n\n\nAddressing the controversy surrounding the treatment, the neurologist said he does not quite understand the \u201cdepth of negativity out there (AD studies are difficult),\u201d and for patients that meet the criteria, he would have no issue prescribing the drug.\n\n\n\n\u201cNet-net,\u201d Yee wrapped up, \u201cHe thinks 60-70% of his patients will remain on therapy after 12 months. 30-40% of patients will 'drop out' due to PET radiopharmacy ordering failures (10-15%), ARIA safety, dosing inconvenience, and noncompliance (skipping dose).\u201d\n\n\n\nAll in all, Yee rates BIIB shares a Buy and his $500 price target implies ~28% upside from current levels. (To watch Yee\u2019s track record, click here)\n\n\n\nOverall, the stock\u2019s Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 15 Buys vs. 12 Holds. The forecast is for one-year gains of 9%, given the average price target clocks in at $426.61.

However, Shares of SAGE plunged 19.3% to close at $58.80 on June 15, as the findings of the WATERFALL study fell short of investors\u2019 expectations.\n\n\n\nSage is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development and commercialization of novel medicines to treat life-altering central nervous system disorders.\u00a0(See Sage Therapeutics stock analysis on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nThe WATERFALL Study was a pivotal, Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Zuranolone 50 mg in adults 18 to 64 years with MDD.\n\n\n\nZuranolone is a two-week, once-daily, oral drug under investigation for the treatment of MDD. The treatment of patients with the drug significantly improved the HAMD-17 readings, a method for measuring depression severity. However, the improvement was just 1.7 points less than the results from the placebo group.\n\n\n\nThe drug was generally well-tolerated in the WATERFALL Study and demonstrated a safety profile consistent with previous clinical studies.\n\n\n\nEfficacy was balanced across patient subgroups, and Day 15 responders retained 86.1% of their improvement at Day 42.\n\n\n\nBarry Greene, the company\u2019s CEO said, \u201cWe dared to imagine a different future for the treatment of MDD where patients have the potential to experience a rapid response that is well-tolerated and that may enable them to stay better with long periods free from depression symptoms, and free from daily chronic treatments and related side effects.\"\n\n\n\nFollowing the announcement, Oppenheimer analyst Jay Olson reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $100, implying 70.1% upside potential to current levels.\n\n\n\nOlson said, \u201cWe believe these results support the rapid-acting profile of Zuranolone as a differentiated approach to episodic MDD, which remains a large unmet need\u2026 We suspect market reaction reflects misconceptions about relative importance of rapid onset vs. durability, providing an attractive entry point for SAGE.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 8 Buys versus 9 Holds. The SAGE average analyst\u00a0price target of $99.92\u00a0implies 70% upside potential to current levels.
