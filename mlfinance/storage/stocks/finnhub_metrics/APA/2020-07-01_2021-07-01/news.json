The new Production Sharing Contract (PSC) will consolidate the majority of the concessions in the Western Desert of Egypt operated by APA Corporation subsidiary Apache Egypt (\u201cApache\u201d) into a single new concession, which will account for more than 90% of the company\u2019s gross production volumes in Egypt on a barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) basis. The changes simplify the contractual relationship with EGPC and include provisions to create a single cost recovery pool, adjust cost oil and gas and profit oil and gas participation, facilitate recovery of prior investment, update day-to-day operational governance, and refresh the term length of both exploration and development leases. The Apache entity that will become the sole contractor is owned two-thirds by Apache and one-third by Sinopec. The new PSC is subject to certain approvals within the Government of Egypt and ratification by Parliament. \u201cEgypt\u2019s Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, H.E. Tarek El Molla, has set important goals to modernize the country\u2019s oil and gas sector and increase foreign investment. Today\u2019s announcement follows nearly a year of discussions focused on those ends, and is great news for Egypt and Apache Egypt,\u201d said John J. Christmann, APA Corporation CEO and president. \u201cThe new agreement in principle confirms Egypt\u2019s commitment to economic development and public-private partnerships and will facilitate higher investment levels by Apache Egypt, resulting in more drilling, more production and more sustainability projects, while also enhancing talent development opportunities and delivering cost efficiencies through the introduction of new technology.\u201d \u201cThe agreement in principle with Apache Egypt is an important step as we modernize Egypt\u2019s petroleum sector and position our country as a regional energy hub,\u201d said H.E. Tarek El Molla, Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, Arab Republic of Egypt. \u201cIt is a win-win for both parties and will help to drive increases in investment and production to the benefit of Egyptians.\u201d About APA APA Corporation owns consolidated subsidiaries that explore for and produce oil and gas in the United States, Egypt and the United Kingdom and that explore for oil and gas offshore Suriname.

Investors have until April 26, 2021 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The Class Period begins on September 7, 2016, when Apache, while under immense pressure to show results from its new strategy and reverse its lagging share price, announced the discovery of a new resource play called Alpine High. Throughout the Class Period, the defendants claimed that Alpine High had valuable oil and gas reserves and promoted Alpine High as the centerpiece of its development business. The truth about Alpine High and its lack of viability emerged in a series of disclosures between April 2019 and March 2020 that caused Apache\u2019s stock price to decline over 83% from its Class Period high. Most recently, on March 16, 2020, a Seeking Alpha article published pre-market explained that Apache was particularly challenged amongst its peers, carrying \u201cthe highest debt-to-equity ratio among large-cap independent [exploration and production companies],\u201d and noted that \u201c[t]he company doesn\u2019t have a strong balance sheet\u201d and its \u201cfinancial health isn\u2019t great.\u201d The article emphasized Apache\u2019s \u201cweak balance sheet marked by high levels of debt\u201d of over $8 billion in 2019, \u201cwhich translates into a lofty debt-to-equity ratio of almost 250% - the highest among all large-cap independent oil producers.\u201d Regarding Alpine High, the article observed that low gas prices \u201cforced Apache to shift capital away from the wet-gas rich Alpine High play which has been driving the company\u2019s production growth.\u201d The article also noted that \u201cApache also reduced Alpine High\u2019s value by $1.4 billion.\u201d Following this news, Apache\u2019s stock price fell $3.61 per share, or approximately 45%, over two trading days, from a close of $8.07 per share on March 13, 2020, to close at $4.46 per share on March 17, 2020.

A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience or resources. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020 founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Apache intentionally used unrealistic assumptions regarding the amount and composition of available oil and gas in Alpine High; (2) Apache did not have the proper infrastructure in place to safely and/or economically drill and/or transport those resources even if they existed in the amounts purported; (3) these misleading statements and omissions artificially inflated the value of Apache\u2019s operations in the Permian Basin; and (4) as a result, defendants\u2019 public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

The Biden Admin is likely to cut back on oil and gas production in the US, in favor of promoting renewable energy sources and carbon pollution reduction. In the short run, his policies are likely to push oil and gas prices up \u2013 and that may turn out to help the hydrocarbon sector, at least at the bottom line, over the coming year.But for the oil companies, the lessons of 2020 appear in the balance sheets. The massive spike down in prices last May, followed by a quick recovery, only to finish the year at roughly the same price as it began \u2013 all of this has the producers looking to cut back on spending, consolidate or reduce debt, and maintain free cash flow. In the words of Raymond James\u2019 oil industry analyst John Freeman: \u201c[We] enter 4Q20 earnings and 2021 capital budget season with WTI trading, ironically, in essentially the same low $50s range as we did this time last year. While crude is largely in the same spot, the industry has definitely undergone a strategic shift with balance sheet health and returning capital to shareholders by far the highest priorities.\u201dIn addition to noting the general trend of the industry after a difficult year, Freeman has also been updating his stance on individual oil and gas stocks. Two in particular have gotten Freeman\u2019s attention. He sees at least 50% upside potential for each of them. We ran the two through TipRanks' database to see what other Wall Street's analysts have to say about them.Apache Corporation (APA)With headquarters in Houston, Texas, Apache is an important operator in the North American oil industry. The company\u2019s US hydrocarbon exploration and production activities are located in the Permian Basin, along the Gulf Coast, and in the Gulf Mexico. Apache also has operations in the UK (in the North Sea), in Egypt (in the Western Desert), and in Suriname (offshore). The company\u2019s Permian holdings include 665.8 million barrels of oil equivalent, 66% of its proven reserves. The company beat the quarterly revenue expectations in the third quarter, with $1.12 billion at the top line. Since reporting the Q3 revenue, Apache\u2019s stock has gained 71%. The company reported 445,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in Q3 production.Covering the stock for Raymond James, analyst John Freeman writes: \u201cWe continue to like Apache's diversified portfolio of U.S. onshore and international assets (Egypt, the North Sea, and Suriname), and given Apache's considerable commodity exposure (only hedged Waha basis in 2021), the company is ideally situated to capitalize on our projected resurgence in commodity prices in the 2021/2022 timeframe. Adding to this, the operator has an extremely robust FCF profile [and] proven commitment to capital discipline\u2026\u201dIn line with these comments, the analyst gives APA a Strong Buy rating and a $24 price target that implies a 60% upside potential over the coming 12 months. (To watch Freeman\u2019s track record, click here)Freeman leads the Bulls on Apache. The stock has a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 12 reviews that include 6 Buys, 5 Holds, and 1 Sell. The shares are selling for $14.94, and their $19.30 average price target suggests room for 29% upside growth this year. (See APA stock analysis on TipRanks)Diamondback Energy (FANG)Also based in Texas, Diamondback Energy is another player in the Permian Basin energy boom. The company boasts an $8.9 billion market cap and saw revenues hit $720 million in the third quarter of 2020. Production in the quarter averaged 287.8 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. Diamondback\u2019s reserves total more than 1.12 billion barrels of oil equivalent, of which 63% are oil and 37% are natural gas and related liquids.Diamondback is expanding its operations through M&A activity. In December of last year, the company announced that it will be acquiring QEP Resources, a natural gas driller in the Midland Basin of the Permian formation along with operations in North Dakota\u2019s Williston formation. The acquisition is an all-stock deal, worth an estimated $2.2 billion. QEP brings 49,000 acres in the Midland for potential development, an average production of 48,300 thousand BOE per day, and 48 \u2018drilled but uncompleted\u2019 wells. These assets are accretive to Diamondback\u2019s portfolio.In a related piece of news, Diamondback has announced that it will also be acquiring Guidon, another rival Texas oil producer. Guidon brings additional Permian assets to Diamondback, and the acquisition is significant, valued at $862 million in both cash and stock.Casting his eye on Diamondback, Freeman sees the company in a strong position to meet the challenges of both the energy environment and the Biden Administration\u2019s regulatory policies. \u201cGoing forward with the addition of QEP and Guidon acreage we anticipate the Midland accounts for ~75% of pro forma activity. Note that even after the QEP/Guidon acquisitions, FANG still has no federal acreage exposure - a significant positive given regulatory uncertainty will likely persist following the expiration of the 60-day leasing moratorium\u2026 We believe FANG offers considerable upside potential over the long-term and are confident in the company's ability to weather near-term commodity uncertainties,\u201d Freeman opined. Unsurprisingly, Freeman rates FANG as a Strong Buy, along with a $91 price target. This figure indicates confidence in ~51% growth over the next 12 months. (To watch Freeman\u2019s track record, click here)There\u2019s broad agreement on Wall Street with Freeman\u2019s position here. FANG stock holds a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 13 recent Buy reviews against just 3 Holds. The average price target is $67.37, which implies ~12% upside from the current trading price of $67.37.

Benzinga's outlook for Apache is included in the following report.What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings also known as net income is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS.Earnings And Revenue Analysts covering Apache have modeled for quarterly EPS loss of $0.34 on revenue of $992.30 million. Apache reported a per-share loss of $0.29 when it published results during the same quarter last year. Sales in that period totaled $1.48 billion.What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the \"consensus estimates.\" A company posting earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate is known as an \"earnings surprise\" and may move the stock by a considerable margin.View more earnings on APAThe Wall Street consensus estimate for earnings would represent a 17.24% decrease for the company. Sales would be down 32.82% on a year-over-year basis. Apache's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past like this:Quarter Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 Q3 2019  EPS Estimate -0.98 -0.30 -0.06 -0.19  EPS Actual -0.74 -0.13 0.08 -0.29  Revenue Estimate 729.65 M 1.30 B 1.61 B 1.46 B  Revenue Actual 596.00 M 1.28 B 1.70 B 1.48 B  Stock Performance Over the last 52-week period, shares are down 61.26%. Given that these returns are generally negative, long-term shareholders won't be happy going into this earnings release.Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call.

The report is available at www.apachecorp.com/Sustainability.  \u201cThe global pandemic has reminded us of life\u2019s essentials \u2013 the necessities for sustaining life and helping people thrive in better times. At the core of those essentials is energy. We need reliable, cleaner and affordable energy supplies to advance society and human progress. We are committed to responsibly providing energy the world needs while being a leader on environment, social and governance issues,\u201d said John J. Christmann IV, Apache's chief executive officer and president.\u201cTo drive ESG performance, we have expanded the scope of ESG goals in our 2020 annual incentive compensation plan and increased their weighting from 10% to 20%. These goals are related to health and safety, greenhouse gas emissions, freshwater use, natural gas flaring, workforce training, and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We understand Apache\u2019s future success depends on our ability to meet the world\u2019s energy needs in ways that are safe, environmentally responsible, innovative and profitable \u2013 for the long-term benefit of all our stakeholders,\u201d Christmann continued.Report highlights include:  * Sharing our commitment to ESG leadership \u2013 In order to have the greatest impact, Apache is focused on the issues most pertinent to and controllable by the company. In addition to a continued focus on safety, the company directs its primary efforts towards air, water, and people and communities.  * Improving health and safety \u2013 Since 2018, Apache has reduced safety incidents for employees and contractors by lowering its Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) by 37% and Days Away, Restricted or Transferred (DART) rate by 49%.  * Reducing methane emissions \u2013 Apache has a rigorous program for preventing, identifying and eliminating leaks of methane. From 2018, the company\u2019s global methane emissions intensity was reduced by 8% and the company achieved its goal of reducing global methane emissions intensity to 0.37% or less of gross methane production in 2019, six years earlier than targeted.  * Using alternatives to fresh water \u2013 In 2019, 95% of the water Apache consumed for operations was obtained from nonfresh sources.  * Benefiting our communities \u2013 Apache\u2019s long-standing commitment to issues such as natural resources conservation and education has established a foundation for identifying opportunities where we can create lasting and sustainable positive impacts. In 2020, Apache is committing 100% of philanthropic dollars in support of causes that align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $12.26.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2020-10-23  * Strike Price: $11.50  * Volume: 4458  * Open Interest: 193065Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume is one indication of unusual options activity. Volume refers to the total shares contracts traded in a day when discussing options activity. Contracts that have been traded, but not closed by a counter-party, are called open interest. A purchased contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for the option.A contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another tell of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are \"out of the money\" are also indicative of unusual options activity. \"Out of the money\" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are \"bullish\" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are \"bearish\" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For August 27, 2020  * Apache's Debt Overview  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For July 20, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.
