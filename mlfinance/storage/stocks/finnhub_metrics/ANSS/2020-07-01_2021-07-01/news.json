The 2021 and 2020 non-GAAP results exclude the income statement effects of the acquisition accounting adjustments to deferred revenue, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and transaction expenses related to business combinations. GAAP and non-GAAP results are as follows: GAAP Non-GAAP(in millions, except percentages and per share data)Q1 2021 Q1 2020 % Change Q1 2021 Q1 2020 % ChangeRevenue$363.2 $305.0 19% $372.1 $308.9 20%Net income$72.4 $46.1 57% $98.9 $72.3 37%Diluted earnings per share$0.82 $0.53 55% $1.12 $0.83 35%Operating profit margin13.8% 11.2% 33.5% 29.3% The non-GAAP financial results highlighted above, and the non-GAAP financial outlook for 2021 discussed below, represent non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the appropriate GAAP measures, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, and for the 2021 financial outlook, can be found in the condensed financial information included in this release. / Other Performance Metrics (in millions, except percentages)Q1 2021 Q1 2020 % Change % Change in Constant CurrencyACV$319.4 $301.1 6% 3%Operating cash flows$171.1 $147.4 16% ACV is a metric the Company uses to better understand the business. There is no GAAP measure comparable to ACV. ACV is composed of the following: the annualized value of maintenance and lease contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period, plusthe value of perpetual license contracts with start dates during the period, plusthe annualized value of fixed-term services contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period, plusthe value of work performed during the period on fixed-deliverable services contracts. / Management's 2021 Financial Outlook The Company's second quarter and fiscal year 2021 revenue and diluted earnings per share guidance is provided below. The Company is also providing its fiscal year 2021 guidance for ACV and operating cash flows. The revenue and diluted earnings per share guidance is provided on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude the income statement effects of acquisition adjustments to deferred revenue, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related transaction expenses. The financial guidance below reflects the Company's current estimates of the adverse impacts of the global pandemic and trade restrictions. This guidance is based on the Company's evaluation of factual information it has determined to be relevant and the application of certain assumptions made by the Company. Please refer to the Company's prepared remarks document for essential additional information regarding the Company's financial guidance, including its assumptions regarding overall business dynamics and the economic impacts of COVID-19 and trade restrictions. / Second Quarter 2021 Guidance The Company currently expects the following for the quarter ending June 30, 2021: (in millions, except per share data)GAAP Non-GAAPRevenue$409.7 - $439.7 $415.0 - $445.0Diluted earnings per share$0.82 - $1.10 $1.43 - $1.67 / Fiscal Year 2021 Guidance The Company currently expects the following for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021: (in millions, except per share data)GAAP Non-GAAPRevenue$1,790.7 - $1,855.7 $1,810.0 - $1,875.0Diluted earnings per share$4.62 - $5.16 $6.69 - $7.10 The difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance presented above is a result of the expected impact of the application of the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations in the amount of $5.3 million for the second quarter and $19.3 million for FY 2021. The FY 2021 revenue and ACV guidance assumes an incremental headwind of approximately $14 million from currency relative to our guidance initiated in February. This currency headwind had an approximately $0.06 per share impact on FY 2021 earnings per share guidance and an approximately $5 million impact on FY 2021 operating cash flow guidance. The Q2 and FY 2021 earnings per share guidance includes a gain of approximately $15.1 million, or $0.14 per share, related to a change in the value of an equity investment. This gain will not affect the Company\u2019s revenue, operating income or cash flows.

We use non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to our competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and spending budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting, (e) to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and (f) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and employees. In addition, many financial analysts that follow us focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that it is in the best interest of our investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the non-GAAP financial information. Moreover, investors have historically requested, and we have historically reported, these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all our competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of our competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. We compensate for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures. The adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below: Acquisition accounting for deferred revenue. Historically, we have consummated acquisitions in order to support our strategic and other business objectives. In accordance with the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, acquired deferred revenue is often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that is lower than the historical carrying value. Although this acquisition accounting requirement has no impact on our business or cash flow, it adversely impacts our reported GAAP revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition. In order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results, we provide non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment. We believe that this non-GAAP financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare our past and future reports of financial results as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related lease licenses and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods. Amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions. We incur amortization of intangible assets, included in our GAAP presentation of amortization expense, related to various acquisitions we have made. We exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by us after the acquisition. Accordingly, we do not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating our performance during the applicable time period after the acquisition, and we exclude such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare our past reports of financial results as we have historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures. Stock-based compensation expense. We incur expense related to stock-based compensation included in our GAAP presentation of cost of maintenance and service; research and development expense; and selling, general and administrative expense. This non-GAAP adjustment also includes excess payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expense (benefit) incurred in connection with our deferred compensation plan held in a rabbi trust includes an offsetting benefit (charge) recorded in other income (expense). Although stock-based compensation is an expense and viewed as a form of compensation, we exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance. We similarly exclude income (expense) related to assets held in a rabbi trust in connection with our deferred compensation plan. Specifically, we exclude stock-based compensation and income (expense) related to assets held in the deferred compensation plan rabbi trust during our annual budgeting process and our quarterly and annual assessments of our performance. The annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby we allocate resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. Additionally, the annual review by our board of directors during which it compares our historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stock-based compensation. In evaluating the performance of our senior management and department managers, charges related to stock-based compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results. In fact, we record stock-based compensation expense into a stand-alone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable. In this way, we can review, on a period-to-period basis, each manager's performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stock-based compensation. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results. Transaction expenses related to business combinations. We incur expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations, which are included in our GAAP presentation of selling, general and administrative expense. These expenses are generally not tax-deductible. We exclude these acquisition-related transaction expenses, derived from announced acquisitions, for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance, as we generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of our operations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results. Non-GAAP tax provision. We utilize a normalized non-GAAP annual effective tax rate (AETR) to calculate non-GAAP measures. This methodology provides better consistency across interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring items and aligning the non-GAAP tax rate with our expected geographic earnings mix. To project this rate, we analyzed our historic and projected non-GAAP earnings mix by geography along with other factors such as our current tax structure, recurring tax credits and incentives, and expected tax positions. On an annual basis we will re-evaluate this rate for significant items that may materially affect our projections. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as listed below: GAAP Reporting MeasureNon-GAAP Reporting MeasureRevenueNon-GAAP RevenueGross ProfitNon-GAAP Gross ProfitGross Profit MarginNon-GAAP Gross Profit MarginOperating IncomeNon-GAAP Operating IncomeOperating Profit MarginNon-GAAP Operating Profit MarginNet IncomeNon-GAAP Net IncomeDiluted Earnings Per ShareNon-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share / About Ansys If you've ever seen a rocket launch, flown on an airplane, driven a car, used a computer, touched a mobile device, crossed a bridge or put on wearable technology, chances are you've used a product where Ansys software played a critical role in its creation.

Ansys (ANSS) Chief Technology Officer, Prith Banerjee, said, \u201cAs part of Ansys\u2019 AV ecosystem, Velodyne is helping to define the landscape of safe autonomous driving. Velodyne\u2019s leading-edge automotive lidar greatly increases the safety and reliability of ADA, powering highly intelligent AVs that improve decision making across many complex edge case scenarios.\u201d Banerjee added, \u201cUsing VRXPERIENCE, OEMs will validate the lidar\u2019s software stack and have full access to a validated sensor model while preserving Velodyne\u2019s IP.\u201d (See Ansys stock analysis on TipRanks) Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) need to test and recognize edge case scenarios. Lidar technology locates and tracks objects across different situations, but to be validated, extensive physical testing is required, increasing the development cost of the system. Under the collaboration, Velodyne is integrating a \u2018black box\u2019 sensor model into Ansys VRXPERIENCE, which is a real-time interactive driving simulator. This will provide the ability to rapidly model a large number of edge case driving scenarios across millions of miles, drastically lowering the number of physical tests needed and in turn, product development costs. Recently, Needham analyst Richard Valera assigned the stock a Hold rating but did not set a price target. Valera commented, \u201cAnsys is a leader in the simulation and analysis market, which is benefiting from a secular trend towards more analysis earlier in the design process.\u201d Overall, the consensus on the Street is that Ansys is a Moderate Buy, based on 4 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $374.57 implies an upside potential of 2.1%. Shares have gained about 54.2% over the past year.

(NASDAQ: ANSS), today reported third quarter 2020 GAAP and non-GAAP revenue growth of 7% in reported currency, or 5% in constant currency, when compared to the third quarter of 2019. For the third quarter of 2020, the Company reported earnings per share of $0.87 and $1.36 on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively, compared to $1.04 and $1.42 on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively, for the third quarter of 2019.\u201cAnsys delivered a strong third quarter in which we overachieved on both earnings and operating margin. While all of our major geographies showed growth, Asia-Pacific was particularly strong, with Japan and South Korea growing by double digits. We also saw double-digit growth in revenue coming from our indirect channel. With corporate initiatives around eco-friendly aircraft engines, Space 2.0 and national defense, we saw robust spending in the aerospace and defense sector during the quarter. We also recently signed a definitive agreement to acquire Analytical Graphics, Inc. (AGI), a leader in mission simulation and analysis, which will strengthen our simulation leadership within the key aerospace and defense sector. Finally, during Q3, our ESG initiatives focused on environmental sustainability, including our own carbon footprint as well as the efficiencies that our solutions are enabling for our customers,\u201d said Ajei Gopal, Ansys president and CEO.Maria Shields, Ansys CFO, stated, \u201cOur solid Q3 financial performance reflects the strength of our core business and the continued dedication and focused execution of the Ansys employees and our partner ecosystem. Despite the challenging circumstances created by the prolonged pandemic, we delivered strong revenue performance, which drove earnings and operating margins. We reported a record third quarter balance of deferred revenue and backlog of $880 million, an increase of 35% over the third quarter of 2019. Additional financial highlights reflecting the resiliency of our business model included ACV growth, which continues to be comprised of a high level of recurring sources at 78% for the quarter and 81% for the first nine months of the year. The combination of our high level of recurring revenue sources, strong financial position and operating discipline positions us well to continue to prudently invest in the business for the long-term. This includes the pending acquisition of AGI, which demonstrates the continued execution of our growth strategy.\u201dOn October\u00a023, 2020, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of the shares of AGI, a premier provider of mission-simulation, modeling, testing and analysis software for aerospace, defense and intelligence applications. Once closed, the acquisition will expand the scope of the Company's offerings, empowering users to solve challenges by simulating from the chip level all the way to a customer's entire mission.

These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. A detailed explanation of each of the adjustments to such financial measures is described below. This press release also contains a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to its most comparable GAAP financial measure.We use non-GAAP financial measures (a)\u00a0to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to our competitors, (b)\u00a0to set internal sales targets and spending budgets, (c)\u00a0to allocate resources, (d)\u00a0to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting, (e)\u00a0to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and (f)\u00a0as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and employees. In addition, many financial analysts that follow us focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that it is in the best interest of our investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the non-GAAP financial information. Moreover, investors have historically requested, and we have historically reported, these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all our competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of our competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. We compensate for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.The adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:Acquisition accounting for deferred revenue.\u00a0Historically, we have consummated acquisitions in order to support our strategic and other business objectives.\u00a0In accordance with the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, acquired deferred revenue is often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that is lower than the historical carrying value. Although this acquisition accounting requirement has no impact on our business or cash flow, it adversely impacts our reported GAAP revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition. In order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results, we provide non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment. We believe that this non-GAAP financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to (a)\u00a0evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decision-making, and (b)\u00a0compare our past and future reports of financial results as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related lease licenses and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods.Amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions.\u00a0We incur amortization of intangible assets, included in our GAAP presentation of amortization expense, related to various acquisitions we have made. We exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by us after the acquisition. Accordingly, we do not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating our performance during the applicable time period after the acquisition, and we exclude such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a)\u00a0evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decision-making, and (b)\u00a0compare our past reports of financial results as we have historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures.Stock-based compensation expense.\u00a0We incur expense related to stock-based compensation included in our GAAP presentation of cost of maintenance and service; research and development expense; and selling, general and administrative expense. This non-GAAP adjustment also includes excess payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expense (benefit) incurred in connection with our deferred compensation plan held in a rabbi trust includes an offsetting benefit (charge) recorded in other income (expense). Although stock-based compensation is an expense and viewed as a form of compensation, we exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance. We similarly exclude income (expense) related to assets held in a rabbi trust in connection with our deferred compensation plan. Specifically, we exclude stock-based compensation and income (expense) related to assets held in the deferred compensation plan rabbi trust during our annual budgeting process and our quarterly and annual assessments of our performance. The annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby we allocate resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. Additionally, the annual review by our board of directors during which it compares our historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stock-based compensation. In evaluating the performance of our senior management and department managers, charges related to stock-based compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results. In fact, we record stock-based compensation expense into a stand-alone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable. In this way, we can review, on a period-to-period basis, each manager's performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stock-based compensation. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a)\u00a0evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and (b)\u00a0review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.Transaction expenses related to business combinations.\u00a0We incur expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations, which are included in our GAAP presentation of selling, general and administrative expense. These expenses are generally not tax-deductible. We exclude these acquisition-related transaction expenses, derived from announced acquisitions, for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance, as we generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of our operations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a)\u00a0evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and (b)\u00a0review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\u00a0We recorded impacts to our income tax provision related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, specifically for the transition tax related to unrepatriated cash and the impacts of the tax rate change on net deferred tax assets. We exclude these impacts for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance, as (i) the charges are not expected to recur as part of our normal operations and (ii) the charges resulted from the extremely infrequent event of major U.S. tax reform, the last such reform having occurred in 1986. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a)\u00a0evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and (b)\u00a0review historical comparability in our financial reporting.Non-GAAP tax provision.\u00a0We utilize a normalized non-GAAP annual effective tax rate (AETR) to calculate non-GAAP measures.\u00a0This methodology provides better consistency across interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring items and aligning the non-GAAP tax rate with our expected geographic earnings mix. To project this rate, we analyzed our historic and projected non-GAAP earnings mix by geography along with other factors such as our current tax structure, recurring tax credits and incentives, and expected tax positions. On an annual basis we will re-evaluate this rate for significant items that may materially affect our projections.Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.We have provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as listed below:GAAP Reporting MeasureNon-GAAP Reporting Measure  RevenueNon-GAAP Revenue  Gross ProfitNon-GAAP Gross Profit  Gross Profit MarginNon-GAAP Gross Profit Margin  Operating IncomeNon-GAAP Operating Income  Operating Profit MarginNon-GAAP Operating Profit Margin  Net IncomeNon-GAAP Net Income  Diluted Earnings Per ShareNon-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share    About AnsysIf you've ever seen a rocket launch, flown on an airplane, driven a car, used a computer, touched a mobile device, crossed a bridge or put on wearable technology, chances are you've used a product where Ansys software played a critical role in its creation.

(NASDAQ: ANSS), today reported second quarter 2020 GAAP and non-GAAP revenue growth of 5% in reported currency, or 5% and 6%, respectively, in constant currency. For the second quarter of 2020, the Company reported earnings per share of $1.11 and $1.55 on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively, compared to $1.28 and $1.61 on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively, for the second quarter of 2019.\u201cQ2 was a very strong quarter for Ansys, with revenue, operating margins and earnings exceeding the high end of our financial guidance. I\u2019m excited that during the quarter we closed both the largest deal in our 50-year history as well as our largest sales agreement for new business. These results demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business and give us confidence for the future,\u201d said Ajei Gopal, Ansys president and CEO.Gopal further stated, \u201cOur recent launch of Ansys 2020 Release 2 delivers enhanced functionality across the simulation portfolio to help customers generate larger, more complex designs easier and faster than ever. And we recently hosted Simulation World, the largest virtual simulation event ever held, to build excitement for those world-class products.\u201d\u201cOur continued focus and ability to adjust our execution against the real-time operating realities of the current business environment yielded strong financial results. These reflect the resiliency of both our business model and our team. Our stronger than expected revenue performance drove operating margins and earnings that were also above the high end of our guidance. Our financial results included growth in both ACV and operating cash flows, while 83% of ACV was from recurring sources in the second quarter. We also reported a record second quarter balance of deferred revenue and backlog of $846 million, an increase of 18% over the second quarter of 2019. While we continue to plan for a challenging market environment in the near term, we remain confident that Ansys is very well positioned with a combination of a strong balance sheet, cash flow from operations and ample liquidity for our ongoing operations and to support future growth aspirations. As we look ahead into the second half of the year, we will continue to balance fiscal discipline with the need to continue to invest in our business to maintain our leadership and to pursue our strategy of making simulation pervasive,\" stated Maria Shields, chief financial officer of Ansys.Financial ResultsAnsys' second quarter and YTD 2020 and 2019 financial results are presented below.

These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. A detailed explanation of each of the adjustments to such financial measures is described below. This press release also contains a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to its most comparable GAAP financial measure.We use non-GAAP financial measures (a)\u00a0to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to our competitors, (b)\u00a0to set internal sales targets and spending budgets, (c)\u00a0to allocate resources, (d)\u00a0to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting, (e)\u00a0to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and (f)\u00a0as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and employees. In addition, many financial analysts that follow us focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that it is in the best interest of our investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the non-GAAP financial information. Moreover, investors have historically requested, and we have historically reported, these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all our competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of our competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. We compensate for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.The adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:Acquisition accounting for deferred revenue.\u00a0Historically, we have consummated acquisitions in order to support our strategic and other business objectives.\u00a0In accordance with the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, acquired deferred revenue is often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that is lower than the historical carrying value. Although this acquisition accounting requirement has no impact on our business or cash flow, it adversely impacts our reported GAAP revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition. In order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results, we provide non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment. We believe that this non-GAAP financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to (a)\u00a0evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decision-making, and (b)\u00a0compare our past and future reports of financial results as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related annual lease licenses and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods.Amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions.\u00a0We incur amortization of intangible assets, included in our GAAP presentation of amortization expense, related to various acquisitions we have made. We exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by us after the acquisition. Accordingly, we do not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating our performance during the applicable time period after the acquisition, and we exclude such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a)\u00a0evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decision-making, and (b)\u00a0compare our past reports of financial results as we have historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures.Stock-based compensation expense.\u00a0We incur expense related to stock-based compensation included in our GAAP presentation of cost of maintenance and service; research and development expense; and selling, general and administrative expense. This non-GAAP adjustment also includes excess payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expense (benefit) incurred in connection with our deferred compensation plan held in a rabbi trust includes an offsetting benefit (charge) recorded in other income (expense). Although stock-based compensation is an expense and viewed as a form of compensation, we exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance. We similarly exclude income (expense) related to assets held in a rabbi trust in connection with our deferred compensation plan. Specifically, we exclude stock-based compensation and income (expense) related to assets held in the deferred compensation plan rabbi trust during our annual budgeting process and our quarterly and annual assessments of our performance. The annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby we allocate resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. Additionally, the annual review by our board of directors during which it compares our historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stock-based compensation. In evaluating the performance of our senior management and department managers, charges related to stock-based compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results. In fact, we record stock-based compensation expense into a stand-alone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable. In this way, we can review, on a period-to-period basis, each manager's performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stock-based compensation. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a)\u00a0evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and (b)\u00a0review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.Transaction expenses related to business combinations.\u00a0We incur expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations, which are included in our GAAP presentation of selling, general and administrative expense. These expenses are generally not tax-deductible. We exclude these acquisition-related transaction expenses, derived from announced acquisitions, for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance, as we generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of our operations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a)\u00a0evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and (b)\u00a0review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\u00a0We recorded impacts to our income tax provision related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, specifically for the transition tax related to unrepatriated cash and the impacts of the tax rate change on net deferred tax assets. We exclude these impacts for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance, as (i) the charges are not expected to recur as part of our normal operations and (ii) the charges resulted from the extremely infrequent event of major U.S. tax reform, the last such reform having occurred in 1986. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a)\u00a0evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and (b)\u00a0review historical comparability in our financial reporting.Non-GAAP tax provision.\u00a0We utilize a normalized non-GAAP annual effective tax rate (AETR) to calculate non-GAAP measures.\u00a0This methodology provides better consistency across interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring items and aligning the non-GAAP tax rate with our expected geographic earnings mix. To project this rate, we analyzed our historic and projected non-GAAP earnings mix by geography along with other factors such as our current tax structure, recurring tax credits and incentives, and expected tax positions. On an annual basis we will re-evaluate this rate for significant items that may materially affect our projections.Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.We have provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as listed below:GAAP Reporting MeasureNon-GAAP Reporting Measure  RevenueNon-GAAP Revenue  Operating IncomeNon-GAAP Operating Income  Operating Profit MarginNon-GAAP Operating Profit Margin  Net IncomeNon-GAAP Net Income  Diluted Earnings Per ShareNon-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share    About AnsysIf you've ever seen a rocket launch, flown on an airplane, driven a car, used a computer, touched a mobile device, crossed a bridge or put on wearable technology, chances are you've used a product where Ansys software played a critical role in its creation.
