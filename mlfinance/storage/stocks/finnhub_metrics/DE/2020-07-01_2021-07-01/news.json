They don\u2019t think about tractors. 10 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks for Your Reliability Short List But that\u2019s the cool thing about the Roaring 2020s. These breakthroughs touch everything. They create new industries and transform old ones. That\u2019s why I think this decade will bring some of the best opportunities investors ever see. Take the story of a 184-year-old company that began with a new way to plow dirt and is now moving headlong into advanced technology. Companies everywhere must do the same \u2026 Autonomous vehicles (AVs) \u2014 or self-driving cars \u2014 will change the way we get around in ways we haven\u2019t seen since Henry Ford introduced the Model T in 1980. AVs are going to reshape the American landscape. How you vacation, where you live, even the way we design our cities and neighborhoods will change. With this much at stake, many of the world\u2019s smartest, richest, most powerful entrepreneurs, investors and corporations are working day and night to make early and strong entrances into this market that will one day be massive. I have no doubt the winners of this race will see their stocks advance 10-fold \u2026 20-fold \u2026 even 100-fold over the coming decade \u2026 taking investors along for the ride of their lives. But autonomous driving technology isn\u2019t just for cars. It isn\u2019t even just for busses, or trains, or airplanes. More than 70 years before Henry Ford introduced the Model T, a blacksmith by the name of John Deere saw a broken steel sawmill blade and had an idea. Farmers had to constantly stop working to knock dirt off their cast-iron plows. Deere thought that if the plows were made of polished steel, the dirt would slide off and make farming a whole lot easier. Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) began in 1837 with what was a \u201chigh tech\u201d plow at the time, and you know the rest of the story. It grew into one of the world\u2019s biggest companies that manufactures all kinds of equipment for agriculture, construction, lawn care and more. Deere continues to embrace innovation and is now focused on new technology that will reshape the company and its industry. The company itself says it is transforming from a \u201cmachinery company\u201d into a \u201csmart technology company.\u201d Investors like what they see. The stock has jumped more than 200% in the last 12 months \u2014 which included the pandemic \u2014 giving the company a valuation of $120 billion. I got to see some of what Deere is up to a little over a year ago at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. I\u2019m more of a city boy, so I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve done a lot of farming or lawn care in my time, but what I saw was cool. The company is focused on three main areas of innovation \u2026 Electric power: The days of tractors growling through the fields and belching smoke into the air are coming to an end. \u201cElectrification is not just about replacing the fuel tank; it\u2019s about replacing the complete engine,\u201d said Martin Kremmer of the John Deere European Technology Center. This results in zero emissions, low maintenance costs and increased efficiency and productivity. Efficiency and productivity will improve even more as next-generation batteries are rolled out. The coming breakthrough battery technology will power all electric vehicles of the future. Deere recognizes its importance \u2026 and so do smart investors. That makes now the time to get in position for the biggest profits. Autonomy: Yes, tractors will drive themselves one day. In fact, some believe tractors might get there before cars because they operate in open fields instead of crowded streets. But in this case, autonomy means more than self-driving. For example, Deere is developing autonomous ways to spray crops. One way is through drones, which would house a scanner that identifies weeds and automatically triggers a pesticide spray when needed. (The drones would also rely on battery power.) Artificial intelligence (AI): High-resolution cameras take 20 pictures per second, and using AI, the system \u201clearns\u201d the difference between weeds and crops. It then sprays weed killer where needed instead of blanketing an entire field. That\u2019s better for the environment, more effective for the farmer and cheaper to boot. With this kind of innovation occurring in industry after industry, you can see why I believe the Roaring 2020s will be a decade for the investing record books. Several once-in-a-generation technologies are converging at the same time and transforming virtually every aspect of our lives \u2014 from healthcare to instant communication to robotics to electric power and much more. Even an industry like farming, which you could say is as old as dirt, is becoming \u201csmart.\u201d The impact these technologies have on the global economy will one day dwarf the internet. To make money, you want to invest in companies leading the way. And to make the big money, you want to do it soon \u2026 while it\u2019s still early.

Melinda Gates, 56, is a former Microsoft manager who\u2019s gained international prominence co-running the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. It\u2019s already given away more than $50 billion.They will remain co-chairs and trustees of the foundation, a spokesperson for the organization wrote in an emailed statement.\u201cNo changes to their roles or the organization are planned,\u201d according to the statement. \u201cThey will continue to work together to shape and approve foundation strategies, advocate for the foundation\u2019s issues, and set the organization\u2019s overall direction.\u201dIt\u2019s the second bombshell divorce among the uppermost ranks of the world\u2019s richest people in recent years, following the 2019 separation announcement of Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Scott.That split, which divided the couple\u2019s stake in Amazon.com Inc., immediately made MacKenzie one of the world\u2019s richest people. In the months that followed, she became one of the most influential philanthropists in the world, giving away billions of dollars to often overlooked causes among billionaire donors.The Gates\u2019s wealth could prove more complex to carve up than the Bezos fortune, which was largely concentrated in Amazon stock.Bill Gates\u2019s net worth originated with Microsoft but shares of the software-maker now probably make up less than 20% of his assets. He\u2019s shifted much of his stake into the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation over the years and his exact stake hasn\u2019t been disclosed since he left Microsoft\u2019s board last year.Gates\u2019s biggest asset is Cascade Investment, a holding company he created with the proceeds of Microsoft stock sales and dividends that\u2019s run by Michael Larson. Through Cascade, Gates has interests in real estate, energy and hospitality as well as stakes in dozens of public companies, including Canadian National Railway and Deere & Co.Monica Mazzei, a divorce attorney and a partner at Sideman & Bancroft LLP in San Francisco, said the big question concerning the couple\u2019s foundation and family office is to what extent they plan on working together going forward.\u201cEven in the most amicable divorces I\u2019ve seen, the preference has been to split the foundation in two so that there\u2019s more autonomy and less intermingling,\u201d she said. The same principle applies to family offices, where the investments could be divvied up into two separate pots.Secrecy PossibleThe pair live in Washington, which is a community property state. That means that anything acquired during a marriage is considered equally owned by both partners, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the fortune will be split in half.\u201cIt is not a mandatory 50-50,\u201d said Janet George, a family lawyer in Washington with the firm McKinley Irvin. \u201cThe courts can award more or less, depending on what is just and equitable.\u201dThe state also mandates a 90-day cooling off period from the day a couple initially files for divorce, and the soonest it can be finalized by a judge. A search of King County public records Monday turned up no such filing from Bill and Melinda Gates.George said the public might never find out how they split the fortune, because it can be hidden behind private contracts.It couldn\u2019t be determined if the two signed a pre-nuptial agreement. Their youngest child is 18.Becoming PhilanthropistsThe pair met in New York in the 1980s, early into Melinda\u2019s time at Microsoft.When deciding whether to marry, Bill made a pro-and-con list on a whiteboard -- Melinda related how she walked into his bedroom to find him tabulating various factors in the Netflix documentary series \u201cInside Bill\u2019s Brain.\u201dThe couple\u2019s philanthropy has always been deeply rooted in their relationship and marriage. The day before they wed in Hawaii, Bill\u2019s mother, Mary, who had been trying to convince him to dramatically increase his charity, gave Melinda a letter which closed with the words \u201cFrom those to whom much is given, much is expected.\u201d Mary Gates died several months later.But it was on a trip to Africa during their engagement that the couple decided they would become serious philanthropists.\u201cWe fell in love with everything we saw but it\u2019s really not at all trite to say that we really fell in love with the people,\u201d Melinda said at a Salesforce event in 2016. \u201cIt just started us on this series of questions of sort of saying to ourselves, \u2018What is going on here?\u2019\u201dLater on in the trip, the couple filled out a marriage questionnaire to make sure they had the same values.
