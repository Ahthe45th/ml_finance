Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that XL Fleet\u2019s salespeople were pressured to inflate their sales pipelines to boost the Company\u2019s reported sales and backlog; (2) that at least 18 of the 33 customers that XL featured were inactive and had not placed an order since 2019; (3) that XL\u2019s technology had been materially overstated and offered only 5% to 10% of fleet savings; (4) that XL lacks the supply chain and engineers to roll out new products on the announced timelines; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants\u2019 positive statements about the Company\u2019s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Bragar Eagel & Squire is investigating certain officers and directors of Alphabet Inc. following a class action complaint that was filed against Alphabet on April 26, 2019. The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company\u2019s data security and management integrity. Specifically, defendants learned of a three-year-long software glitch in the Google+ social media network that potentially exposed the private personal data of millions of Google+ users to third-parties, and led to the discovery of other systemic vulnerabilities that further compromised the data security of Google+ users. Defendants knew of these data-security issues in March of 2018, but for months, they continued to stress to investors the importance of data security and simply warned investors about risks related to data-security issues and concerns, while concealing that these risks had already been realized and that defendants had such poor security controls and record keeping that they could not determine the scope of the data breach, identify all of the affected users, detect other data-security bugs, or protect the private personal data of the tens of millions of Google+ users. The Wall Street Journal (\u201cWSJ\u201d) led the exposure of defendants\u2019 scheme, triggering governmental investigations, Congressional hearings, the shutdown of the Google+ social media network, undermined confidence in the integrity of defendants\u2019 data security and management, and damaged investors.

Troy Dye is the senior vice president, growth at Metromile, Inc. SAN FRANCISCO, May 14, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Metromile, Inc. (NASDAQ: MILE, MILEW), a leading digital insurance platform and pay-per-mile auto insurer, today announced Capital One marketing veteran Troy Dye will join the company in the new role of Senior Vice President, Growth on May 24, 2021. He will oversee a fast-growing team of growth, acquisition, brand and marketing professionals as a member of the leadership team. Dye will be responsible for bringing Metromile\u2019s vision of fairer and real-time insurance to more drivers at a time when consumers increasingly seek pay-per-mile auto insurance and greater flexibility and digital experiences from their insurer. \u201cHaving spent more than 20 years at Capital One, Troy stood out as a disciplined, data-driven marketer who balances growth and profitability,\u201d said Metromile Chief Executive Officer Dan Preston. \u201cTroy joins at a critical juncture as we rapidly scale the business in our existing footprint and lay the groundwork to bring Metromile to more than 100 million drivers nationwide. He is a hands-on team leader, strategist and operator, and I am confident he will drive our growth engine forward.\u201d Dye has focused his marketing career transforming brands and marketing machines for large, data-driven and digital personal finance products. He was most recently Managing Vice President and Head of Card Marketing, Engagement and Insights for Capital One\u2019s (NYSE: COF) domestic consumer credit card business. Previously, he held executive roles leading marketing for Capital One\u2019s small business credit card and partnerships divisions and the brand strategy for the U.S. credit card business and the marketing team in Canada. He was also a Practice Manager for the small business practice at Corporate Executive Board, helping Fortune 500 companies effectively market to small business owners. \u201cAs a Metromile customer, I have seen firsthand how the company sets itself apart through its personalized experience and impactful savings,\u201d said Dye. \u201cI am thrilled to join Metromile as pay-per-mile auto insurance hits a tipping point, and I look forward to providing drivers a better value proposition and expanding our reach across the country.\u201d Dye also serves on the board of directors of NextUp, a nonprofit organization focused on providing quality after-school programs for middle school students in Richmond, Virginia.

The digital insurance platform\u2019s data from the first three months of 2021 indicates driving is returning to as much as 95% of pre-pandemic levels. Social trends, such as increased remote work and larger suburban and rural communities, point to a new normal with more Americans changing how they get around and becoming low-mileage drivers, looking for new ways to save.

(f/k/a K12, Inc.) (NYSE: LRN), Capital One (NYSE: COF), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) on behalf of long-term stockholders. More information about each potential case can be found at the link provided. Stride, Inc. (f/k/a K12, Inc.) (NYSE: LRN) Bragar Eagel & Squire is investigating certain officers and directors of Stride, Inc. following news that the Shareholder Class Action against Stride has survived the motions to dismiss in the pending securities class action and may face damages. According to the securities class action complaint, during the class period defendants made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose adverse information concerning Merit\u2019s business and prospects. Specifically, defendants failed to disclose that: (a) the integrations of Cianna and Vascular Insights, including their products, sales people, and R&D facilities, had caused operational disruptions and reduced sales and were months behind schedule; (b) sales of acquired company products had slowed substantially due to pre-acquisition pipeline fill, in particular for Vascular Insights products which, as late as July 2019, had zero orders during fiscal 2019; and (c) in light of the foregoing, the Company\u2019s reported financial guidance for fiscal 2019 and 2020 was made without a reasonable basis. As a result of defendants\u2019 material misrepresentations and omissions, Merit stock traded at artificially inflated prices of more than $62 per share. On March 29, 2021, U.S. District Judge David O. Carter denied defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 claims, finding that plaintiffs had plausibly alleged securities fraud claims.

The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company did not maintain robust information security protections, and its protection did not shield personal information against security breaches; (2) such deficiencies heightened the Company's exposure to a cyber-attack; and (3) as a result, Capital One's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on our investigation into Capital One go to: https://bespc.com/cases/cof Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Bragar Eagel & Squire is investigating certain officers and directors of Alphabet Inc. following a class action complaint that was filed against Alphabet on April 26, 2019. The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company\u2019s data security and management integrity. Specifically, defendants learned of a three-year-long software glitch in the Google+ social media network that potentially exposed the private personal data of millions of Google+ users to third-parties, and led to the discovery of other systemic vulnerabilities that further compromised the data security of Google+ users. Defendants knew of these data-security issues in March of 2018, but for months, they continued to stress to investors the importance of data security and simply warned investors about risks related to data-security issues and concerns, while concealing that these risks had already been realized and that defendants had such poor security controls and record keeping that they could not determine the scope of the data breach, identify all of the affected users, detect other data-security bugs, or protect the private personal data of the tens of millions of Google+ users. The Wall Street Journal (\u201cWSJ\u201d) led the exposure of defendants\u2019 scheme, triggering governmental investigations, Congressional hearings, the shutdown of the Google+ social media network, undermined confidence in the integrity of defendants\u2019 data security and management, and damaged investors.

OneStream plans to be ready for a public share sale next year, although actual timing may vary based on market conditions, Chief Financial Officer Bill Koefoed said in an interview. The Rochester, Michigan-based software maker had sales of $130 million in 2019 and hasn\u2019t disclosed more recent revenue. It has been shifting customers to subscriptions that generate a regular sales stream \u2014 annual recurring revenue has doubled in the quarter that just ended and totals about $150 million, Koefoed said. The company sells software that helps a CFO\u2019s office report financial information to regulators and investors, as well as manage financial and operational planning. Customers include United Parcel Service Inc., Toyota Motor Corp. and Capital One Financial Corp. It competes with Oracle Corp., SAP SE, Anaplan Inc. and Blackline Inc.The company, which was founded in 2010, is trying to help CFOs have a more up-to-date view of their numbers, moving from an earlier world where figures got tallied once a month to today\u2019s goal of real-time information. The pandemic has made companies realize they can\u2019t rely on planning that\u2019s rapidly obsolete, OneStream Chief Executive Officer Tom Shea said. In the most recent quarter, bookings rose 200%, the company said. \u201cWhat happened when the pandemic hit is anybody that was running a business realized their plans were pretty much garbage,\u201d Shea said. \u201cYou had no idea what demand looked like, you didn't know if someone was going to pay you. The first thing that happened on, let\u2019s call it March 9 of last year, is everybody started to realize that those that had invested in tools and had the information they needed to understand where they were at that moment \u2014 they were OK, and those that didn\u2019t realized that they needed to invest.\u201dThe company, which KKR took a majority stake in two years ago, plans to use the funds to fuel research and development in the product and its expansion into the Asia Pacific region, Shea said.

Now, they\u2019re seizing the moment.Card companies Capital One Financial Corp. and American Express Co. said this week they\u2019ve jump-started marketing efforts in recent weeks to bolster their brands and acquire new customers. And they plan to keep up the push through the holiday season.\u201cThis is the biggest disconnect that I certainly have experienced in my three decades of building Capital One between what we see in the economy itself and the actual performance of the consumer,\u201d Capital One Chief Executive Officer Richard Fairbank said on a conference call Thursday. Still, he cautioned, \u201cthis is not a declaration that we see the light at the end of the tunnel.\u201dThe fourth quarter is generally the busiest for card issuers\u2019 marketing and customer-acquisition efforts, with many consumers applying for new credit lines or using up existing card rewards for their holiday shopping.But investors had been wondering what this year would look like, given the surge in unemployment caused by the Covid-19 crisis and resulting recession, and lenders\u2019 stockpiling of reserves since the pandemic started. The last three months of 2020 will be particularly fraught for credit quality, with U.S. and worldwide Covid-19 cases spiking again and raising the prospect of additional pressure on consumers and the economy.Capital One expects \u201ca significant sequential increase\u201d in marketing costs in the last three months of the year after spending $283 million in the third quarter. At AmEx, executives said such costs should be similar to the $1.8 billion spent last quarter. That would be more than the $1.6 billion in marketing and business-development costs analysts were expecting.\u201cDuring times like this, probably the go-to move is to reduce marketing, but we don\u2019t believe that\u2019s true,\u201d AmEx CEO Stephen Squeri said on a conference call Friday. \u201cThe most important thing we can do is solidify our foundation.\u201dDiscover Financial Services, for its part, sought to maintain new-account marketing throughout the pandemic even as competitors pulled back, CEO Roger Hochschild said Thursday.\u201cIf the economic environment continues to improve, it\u2019s natural that we\u2019re going to spend more money on customer acquisition,\u201d Hochschild said. \u201cBut the other expense lines -- professional fees, information processing, other miscellaneous expense -- we\u2019re going to keep a foot on those.\u201dAdding customers comes with risks. Card companies don\u2019t want to be a borrower\u2019s lender of last resort should the economy continue to suffer, and it can take years for new customers to become profitable.In recent years, many lenders have focused on adding cardholders who tend not to carry a balance, known in the industry as \u201ctransactors.\u201d For these customers, companies reap billions of dollars in swipe fees when credit cards are used at checkout. But even that model is now being strained, given that the biggest swipe fees are paid by airlines, hotels and other retailers in travel and entertainment -- industries hurt most by the pandemic.\u201cAs far top-line growth for new cards acquired,\u201d Squeri warned, \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be hard to see the top-line growth, because you\u2019ve got this compression that\u2019s happened due to travel.\u201dFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=6abf2f58a8110b6baf2c63ee0d178a170a7a97a73d90ff49e135a78c590605b8"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1603455022, "headline": "BUZZ-U.S. STOCKS ON THE MOVE-Socket Mobile Inc, Iterum Therapeutics, American Express", "id": 61117744, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2020-09-11T190308Z_709939120_RC2JWI9SGZOJ_RTRMADP_2_HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-GLOBAL-FINANCIAL.JPG?899831473", "related": "COF", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "A compilation of the most active stocks on U.S. exchanges.
