Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson said in an interview Thursday.\u201cThere\u2019s no shale oil for copper,\u201d he told Bloomberg Television. \u201cUnlike the oil industry, where you have an ongoing flow of discoveries and now with a new element of shale coming in, copper mines of size are very rare to find.\u201dBets on tight supplies have sent copper prices to record levels as major economies emerge from the pandemic and the energy transition boosts the outlook for the metal used in electric installations. The rally has cooled somewhat with the outlook of a tapering by the U.S. Federal Reserve and China\u2019s efforts to ease a commodities price surge.The industry is facing a supply scarcity that will require both copper substitution and increasing recycling, Adkerson said.

Stocks to Buy After Great Earnings: Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) The inflation trade is heating up in 2021. Copper prices have been ripping alongside other industrial commodities, and companies like Freeport-McMoRan have been massive beneficiaries of the trend. Roughly 80% of FCX\u2019s revenue comes from copper. On the earnings front, Freeport reported EPS of 51 cents on $4.85 billion in revenue. The numbers came in line with earnings expectations but slightly missed revenue forecasts of $4.87 billion. But here\u2019s the thing. The stock didn\u2019t really budge \u2013 despite what could be described as less than stellar results. Given that FCX stock has climbed so much over the past six months, I think this is a huge win and bodes well for prices moving forward. Source: The thinkorswim\u00ae platform from TD Ameritrade The pullback pattern has FCX testing its rising 50-day and 20-day moving averages. This is as good a buy-the-dip setup as any. The Trade: Buy the June $35/$40 bull call spread for $1.80. AT&T (T) AT&T entered earnings with a chart in need of a boost. It\u2019s been stuck in a trading range for the past year and found itself stuck in the middle heading into the event. Fortunately, the telecom and media giant released one of its best showings in years. For the first quarter, AT&T earned an adjusted 86 cents per share on revenue of $43.94 billion. Analysts were expecting 78 cents per share on $42.69 billion in revenue. Source: The thinkorswim\u00ae platform from TD Ameritrade Though T stock closed well off its intraday highs, the close of $31.36 still places prices at the highest level of 2021. We\u2019re now testing the upper end of the one-year range. Any kind of basing in this area could precede an upside breakout over major resistance at $32. This would finally turn the weekly trend higher and inject some excitement into what has otherwise been an extremely dull stock. 7 Retail Stocks With E-Commerce Locked In The improved outlook for AT&T\u2019s fundamentals should help support the stock over the coming quarter. To capitalize, I like diagonal call spreads. The Trade: Buy the June $30 call while selling the May $32 call for a net debit of $1.50. Stocks to Buy After Great Earnings: D.R. Horton (DHI) On Main Street, housing prices have been rapidly climbing in the wake of the pandemic. On Wall Street, traders have gobbled up homebuilding stocks as a way to bank on the trend. D.R. Horton is already up 39% year-to-date and just posted robust quarterly profits. That makes it a perfect final candidate for today\u2019s stocks-to-buy gallery. The Texas-based home construction company earned $2.53 per share on total revenue of $6.45 billion. Both metrics exceeded analyst forecasts. DHR stock ended the day with a powerful bullish engulfing candle at the rising 20-day moving average. Volume swelled throughout the session to confirm institutions and other big buyers entering the fray. Source: The thinkorswim\u00ae platform from TD Ameritrade DHR is a choppier stock, so I fully expect some backing and filling along the way. But the trend direction is undeniably higher, and $100 beckons as the obvious next target. The Trade: Buy the June $95/$100 for $2.15.

At its Cerro Verde mine in Peru, Freeport plans to get back to pre-pandemic levels next year.At a time of robust demand and production disruptions elsewhere, Freeport\u2019s expansion provides some relief for smelters and consumers of the metal used in wiring. Rather than a spike, Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson sees copper\u2019s rally to above $4 a pound as supported by fundamentals -- with scarce stockpiles, strong demand and dearth of big new projects waiting in the wings.\u201cThe outlook for copper has never been better,\u201d Adkerson said on a conference call Thursday, citing structural deficits that support higher prices.In the first quarter, Freeport reported output of 910 million pounds compared with the 825.4 million average of analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company now expects to sell about 3.85 billion pounds this year, up slightly from a January projection, and sees annual sales growing to 4.4 billion pounds in the next two years.Cost HeadwindRising production costs are one of the only headwinds to earnings growth, with the company matching cash cost estimates in the quarter but raising its projection for the year amid pricier energy and freight. Adjusted earnings came in at 51 cents a share in the first quarter compared with the 50-cent average estimate. Sales met expectations.CEO Adkerson said the company had resumed evaluations of future growth projects and expects to have that process ready by year-end. With high copper prices indicating debt targets will be met around the same time, Freeport will then look at other capital allocation opportunities such as additional dividends.\u201cWith Freeport\u2019s major transition year at Grasberg now mostly in the rearview mirror, we expect the company to have ample financial flexibility to re-deploy and accelerate key capital allocation priorities, such as capital returns and leverage optimization,\u201d B. Riley Securities analyst Lucas Pipes wrote in a note to clients.The one remaining component of its Indonesian strategy are smelters. The company agreed to build a smelter as part of renewing its contracts at Grasberg, and has been working with the government on proposals. A decision is yet to be made on proceeding with a project alone or with partners.The company\u2019s shares have more than quadrupled in value in the past year in one of the best performances among copper suppliers tracked by Bloomberg Intelligence. The stock was down 2.8% at 11:20 a.m. in New York.Freeport is focused on expanding its its own assets rather than looking at growth through acquisitions after making M&A missteps in past cycles.\u201cWe have no strategy of engaging in M&A markets, but we\u2019ll be positioned now for the first time in a long, long time to take advantage of an opportunity that comes to us,\u201d Adkerson said.(Updates with CEO comment on copper price and capital allocation)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=5bbd9e4be959f59f0c87886425884dfb56186edb912efcd167d7948b8bb63f17"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619105523, "headline": "Freeport's (FCX) Q1 Earnings In-Line, Sales Lag Estimates", "id": 66273299, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ShfhwtDyA2WzDBKdAL7M8Q--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MzU7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/zacks.com/6f2cab89bf2cbad1966358e04258e202", "related": "FCX", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "Freeport's (FCX) Q1 earnings gain from higher realized prices and lower costs.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=f11860a4b7d3d7aa8757af05934dd3588d4f56e7f6fff7fe8b082c16e9a12b55"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619099029, "headline": "Freeport-McMoRan Inc. 2021 Q1 - Results - Earnings Call Presentation", "id": 66194671, "image": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "related": "FCX", "source": "SeekingAlpha", "summary": "The following slide deck was published by Freeport-McMoRan Inc.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=cdd3118595795b3a99e5fe89a6f7915dada4e105edbe5d068661a37b9460829f"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619097901, "headline": "Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) Matches Q1 Earnings Estimates", "id": 66587335, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nxwFIPS2ImeTQYZMYlnAgg--~B/aD02MDA7dz05MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/zacks.com/1a018a29aef5adbf5b4319f32058e209", "related": "FCX", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) delivered earnings and revenue surprises of 0.00% and -0.31%, respectively, for the quarter ended March 2021.
