The sale of NFTs reflects an expansion of the company\u2019s digital collectibles business. The popularity of NFTs has increased significantly this year, especially after artwork by Beeple was sold for a whopping $69 million. Initially, the retailer is allowing the auction of select NFT categories, such as trading cards, music, and art. It will use the initial rollout as an experiment to gather feedback and learn more about its community's preferences. From there, it expects to expand to more categories, and also establish programs and tools to facilitate its NFT marketplace. eBay aims to be the top marketplace for collectibles, and plans to add blockchain-based collectibles in the future. \u201cIn the coming months, eBay will add new capabilities that bring blockchain-driven collectibles to our platform,\u201d said Jordan Sweetnam, Senior Vice President and General Manager, North America. It is unclear whether the planned introduction of blockchain-based products will open the door to eBay accepting cryptocurrency payments. (See eBay stock analysis on TipRanks) Baird analyst Colin Sebastian reiterated a Buy rating with a $65 price target on eBay stock. Sebastian\u2019s price target implies a 7.56% upside potential to the current price. The analyst says that eBay\u2019s Q1 earnings results were impressive and that the company\u2019s prospects are bright. For example, there is still plenty of opportunity for the company to grow its eCommerce, digital advertising, and payments revenue. \u201ceBay\u2019s properties generate a significant amount of Internet traffic, which the company monetizes primarily through advertising, revenue sharing and fees from classifieds,\u201d noted Sebastian. The consensus rating is a Moderate Buy based on 8 Buy and 10 Hold ratings. The average analyst price target of $70.44 points to 16.56% upside potential to current levels. EBAY scores a 6 out of 10 on TipRanks\u2019 Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock is likely to perform in line with market averages.

But only the biggest ones are poised to reap the long-term benefit of changing consumer habits.In earnings reports this week, Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google detailed the ways people have become more dependent on their offerings since shutdowns and quarantines changed how people shop, work, learn and interact -- saying these trends could drive growth long-term.Meanwhile, smaller social networks Twitter Inc. and Pinterest Inc. disappointed investors, with the former forecasting revenue that missed estimates and the latter warning that user growth is waning in the U.S. EBay Inc. said sales gains during the outbreak would fade as consumers get vaccinated and stimulus checks run out. The contrast underscored how the already-dominant players are leveraging their strength and size to further entrench their ubiquity.Amazon added customers for grocery delivery, sold more Alexa speakers, and signed on more businesses to its cloud computing service -- a trend it expects \u201cto continue as we move into the post-pandemic recovery,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on an investor call. Google pressed its case that Chromebooks are the best tools for virtual school and that YouTube can rival television as personal entertainment -- making it more worthy of advertiser investment.Both Google and Facebook spoke about how the pandemic has accelerated small businesses\u2019 shifts to the web, using their platforms for e-commerce advertising and sales. Such businesses are \u201casking us what we can do to help them not just now, but over the long run,\u201d Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said.Even before the Covid-19 outbreak gave the internet giants new ways to cement their places in consumers\u2019 everyday life, the companies were under scrutiny for potentially anti-competitive behavior. All three have faced Congressional antitrust probes amid concerns they have built empires at the expense of healthy competition and consumer choice. Their results during the pandemic may open up new questions about their potential monopolies -- with in-person retail and entertainment options shuttered, consumers who had fewer choices for spending time and money turned their attention to the convenient, omnipresent tech behemoths.Where consumers went, product marketers followed. The pandemic\u2019s effects have been most dramatic in digital advertising, particularly campaigns for e-commerce. Sandberg said Facebook\u2019s ad results in the first quarter were buoyed by consumers purchasing more goods online. The social-media company\u2019s average price per ad jumped a whopping 30%, indicating that healthy demand allowed it to charge more for each spot.Amazon\u2019s \u201cother\u201d revenue, which includes advertising, surged 77% to $6.9 billion, \u201canother indication that the boost to Amazon\u2019s business last year shows no sign of ebbing,\u201d according to Nicole Perrin of researcher EMarketer.Google spent the past quarter serving up more ads from retail and travel companies eager to reach consumers who are starting to spend again. Ruth Porat, chief financial officer of Google parent Alphabet Inc., said the durability of that trend will depend on the pace of the global coronavirus recovery, but some analysts are more bullish on the internet giant\u2019s prospects to take advantage of a great reopening in subsequent quarters.Philipp Schindler, Google\u2019s chief business officer, said the company\u2019s \u201csweet spot\u201d is a blend of online and offline purchases facilitated by products like Search, Maps and YouTube. Google has helped big retailers such as Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Inc. and arts-and-crafts chain Michaels Cos. fulfill orders with customers looking for curbside pickup options or trying to locate products available near them.\u201cTrends are likely to continue as the broader economic recovery takes hold throughout 2021 and the ramp in digital adoption trends becomes more permanent,\u201d JMP Securities analyst Ron Josey wrote in a recent note. \u201cWe were most impressed with core search advertising results as Google highlighted strength across most advertising categories, with a core focus on retail and that travel is seeing renewed interest among users.\u201dThe internet giants\u2019 advertising and e-commerce revenue streams were immune to some of the problems facing other tech leaders during the pandemic. Apple Inc., also named in the Congressional antitrust investigation, makes most of its money from hardware, meaning it\u2019s more vulnerable to supply chain risks. Company executives this week said it will see a negative $3 billion to $4 billion impact in the June quarter from chip shortages hitting iPads and Macs, two product lines that gained popularity during the pandemic.Apple has in turn been focusing more on non-hardware revenue, including from the App Store, Apple Music, gaming, cloud storage, technical support, advertising and video. That Services division now brings in more than $50 billion a year in sales.At a fraction of the size of Facebook, rival social network Twitter has missed out on fully capitalizing on the ad spending bonanza in part because the company sells more promotions meant to help companies improve their brand recognition, as opposed to ads that lead people to directly buy products. With consumers at home on their phones, online shopping became a pastime, as spending shifted from travel and events to groceries, home improvement and more comfortable wardrobes.Meanwhile, Pinterest and EBay both saw an increase in activity during lockdowns, but cautioned that those gains probably won\u2019t last. \u201cStarting in mid-March, the easing of pandemic restrictions slowed U.S. MAU growth and lowered engagement year over year as people spent less time online,\u201d Pinterest said in a statement. When government stimulus checks run out, EBay expects spending to recede, too.Facebook also expects that people won\u2019t be as dependent on its apps for entertainment and connection as they get vaccinated and return to in-person activity with friends and family. But the shift back isn\u2019t likely to be at a scale to concern investors.\u201cI don\u2019t think anything hugely dramatic,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Dave Wehner said on Thursday.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=11a0401a5ae76c7fa0b43baa645f5393e6f9f8c5c4b4d5cf9c533f71c6f8475e"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619866800, "headline": "Validea Joel Greenblatt Strategy Daily Upgrade Report - 5/1/2021", "id": 67205423, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?784619964", "related": "EBAY", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "The following are today's upgrades for Validea's Earnings Yield Investor model based on the published strategy of Joel Greenblatt.

The company posted a 42% year-on-year rise in revenues to $3 billion in the first quarter, beating analysts\u2019 estimates of $2.97 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.09 per share came in ahead of consensus estimates of $1.07 per share. eBay\u2019s CEO, Jamie Iannone said, \u201cWe delivered another strong quarter for the company and an excellent start to the year for our buyers and sellers. We generated tremendous volume and earnings, with revenue growth the highest it has been since 2005. Last July, I laid out our vision for a Tech-led reimagination of eBay and our results prove this long-term strategy is working.\u201d eBay scaled up its global management of payments during the quarter with managed payments processing over 52% of global on-platform volume. At the end of 1Q, over 4 million sellers globally had migrated to eBay\u2019s managed payments services. eBay reported gross merchandise volume (GMV) of $27.5 billion in 1Q, up 29% year-on-year. For the second quarter, eBay expects revenues of between $2.98 billion and $3.03 billion. The company has also declared a cash dividend of $0.18 per share payable on June 18 to shareholders of record as of June 1. (See eBay stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the 1Q earnings, Guggenheim analyst Robert Drbul lowered the price target from $75 to $70 and reiterated a Buy on the stock. Drbul commented on the earnings, \u201cWhile the company will be facing tougher comparisons in the quarters ahead (we modestly lower our 2021 Marketplace GMV and EPS estimates as such), we continue to believe EBAY shares offer an attractive risk/reward at today\u2019s levels.\u201d \u201cIn our view, we continue to be encouraged by increased interest and relevancy around the eBay platform (active buyers up +7% in 1Q), in part led by the continued significant growth in sneaker and trading card popularity, along with continued heavy investment in marketing and product development which should support sustained relevancy in coming periods,\u201d Drbul added. Overall, consensus on the Street is that EBAY is a Moderate Buy based on 8 Buys and 13 Holds. The average analyst price target of $70.12 implies upside potential of about 12.5% from current levels.

Google parent Alphabet Inc., Facebook Inc. and Shopify Inc. all hinted at lasting momentum in their earnings reports this week, sending their shares higher. EBay joined social media platform Pinterest Inc. as a potentially short-lived pandemic phenom.\u201cThis is a relative challenge for EBay to not be able to fully hang on to the gains from the pandemic,\u201d said Ygal Arounian, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc.Sales will be $2.98 billion to $3.03 billion in the second quarter, the San Jose, California-based company said in a statement. Earnings, excluding some items, will be 91 cents to 96 cents a share. Analysts estimated profit of 98 cents a share on sales of $2.95 billion.Pandemic-wary consumers have turned to online marketplaces like Amazon.com Inc. and EBay, which said it ended the quarter with 187 million active buyers, an increase of 7% from a year earlier. The big question for investors is whether the change in shopping habits will endure post-outbreak and if shoppers will start shifting some of their disposable income to traveling and eating out once most people are vaccinated. Amazon is scheduled to report results on Thursday.EBay Chief Executive Officer Jamie Iannone, who took the reins last year, is looking to generate more revenue from advertising and payments, businesses that can offset slow growth of the company\u2019s core online marketplace. He is trying to boost sales of luxury watches and sneakers, hoping enthusiasts for those products explore other corners of the site and spend money in other areas like home goods and apparel.Gross merchandise volume, the value of all goods sold on the site, rose 29% in the first quarter to $27.5 billion. Analysts predicted $26.2 billion.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=712407df7e7fd3f68b3ea63bfbb7a21e1a2b31255c83a1eafe8806a706a3b244"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619652547, "headline": "eBay Inc.

Investors may seek out undervalued stocks to invest in for the long term, hoping the market eventually realizes the stock is trading lower than its actual value and makes an upward correction. How A Stock Is Deemed Undervalued: A stock is considered undervalued based on its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E). A stock's P/E is found by dividing the stock\u2019s current share price by its earnings per share (EPS) over the past 12 months. A high P/E indicates the stock is trading above its value and could therefore be overvalued, while a low P/E means it is trading below its value and could therefore be overvalued. As an example, if a stock is trading at $40 and has an EPS of $4, it has a P/E ratio of 10, meaning that for every share investors purchase, they claim $10 in earnings. This is considered a low P/E and could indicate the stock is undervalued. Conversely, if a stock is trading at $40 per share and has an EPS of $1, it has a P/E ratio of 40 meaning that for every share investors purchase they claim only $1 in earnings. This is considered a high P/E and could indicate the stock is overvalued. Four Stocks That May Be Undervalued: EBay, a San Jose-based multinational e-commerce company, has a 12-month EPS of $7.89 ended Friday's trading at $62.47, giving it a P/E of 7.92. This may indicate it is undervalued. When eBay reported fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 3, its revenue was up 28% to $2.9 billion, showing it may be going through a period of high growth. SunPower, a San Jose-based solar energy company, has a 12-month EPS of $2.48 and ended Friday's trading at $29.71, giving it a P/E ratio of 11.99. This may indicate it is undervalued. When SunPower reported fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 17, the company said it had added 13,000 new customers. With the push for renewable energy, this may continue to grow, bringing the company increasing revenue. Regeneron, the Westchester County-based biotechnology company, has a 12-month EPS of $30.52 and ended Friday's trading at $475.17, giving it a P/E ratio of 15.57. This may indicate it is undervalued. When Regeneron reported its fourth-quarter results on Feb. 5 it had increased revenues by 30% compared to fourth-quarter 2019, showing sustained growth. Tupperware, an Orlando-based multi-level marketing company with an extensive home product line, has a 12-month EPS of $2.14 and ended Friday's trading at $27.02, giving it a P/E ratio of 12.63. This may indicate it is undervalued. When Tupperware released its fourth-quarter results on March 10, it said its global sales were up 17%, 20% in local currency, compared to the year prior.

Later events will be held in Nashville, April 13-14; Seattle, April 21-22; Las Vegas, April 30-May 1 and Austin, May 7-8.

The events are free and eBay will provide snacks and beverages to participants, who are allowed to bring one item for an appraisal.

In creating these events, eBay stated it sought to ensure items being prepared for online sale carry proper valuations. \"Younger generations have upended the idea of a traditional portfolio by marrying their passions with financial opportunity,\" said Jordan Sweetnam, senior vice president of eBay North America. \"We've transformed the eBay experience to reflect that change in behavior, ensuring the authenticity of the most covetable, collectible and investment-worthy items in our marketplace.\" Related Link: Should Amazon Try To Acquire Alibaba, Jumia Or eBay In 2021?
