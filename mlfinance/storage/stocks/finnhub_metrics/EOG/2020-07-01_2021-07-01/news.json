Indeed, while the market focuses on popular meme stocks, alternative energy plays, tech and Tesla, the best place to make money in 2021 has been that old warhorse, the crude patch.Oil & gas shares are up 40% this year compared with a 11% gain in the broad equities benchmark. Despite headwinds from regulatory concerns and the popularity of ESG investing, the group has continued to surge higher on rising oil prices, improving earnings and a market-wide rotation into value stocks. The mantra of limited capital spending and low growth appears to be working. Even the hacking of the largest fuel pipeline in the U.S. last week couldn\u2019t halt the gains.Macro dynamics are favorable, and share prices remain wildly undervalued as the broader investment community continues to ignore the space, according to New York-based Goehring & Rozencwajg Associates LLC. That probably won\u2019t last with these returns, considering Marathon Oil Corp. is up a whopping 77% this year, while Devon Energy Corp,. EOG Resources Inc. and Diamondback Energy Inc. have all soared more than 60% since the start of 2021. But so far, investors appear to be staying away.\u201cTo date, we have not seen any material flow of funds from generalist investors\u201d or institutional money, says managing partner Adam Rozencwajg. \u201cThe move will be violent when it happens.\u201dShrinking PresencePart of this may come down to simple index weightings, where energy has become just a tiny slice of the stock market. The group accounts for less than 3% of the S&P 500 after being in the double digits 10 years ago.Energy bulls got a little encouragement in February when Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. disclosed a stake in Chevron Corp., according to Bank of Montreal capital markets. Berkshire\u2019s ownership stole headlines, though BMO\u2019s scan of 13F filings also showed broad-based increases in active long-only ownership across E&P stocks after steady declines in recent years, analyst Phillip Jungwirth told clients in a February note.Shale drillers also offer hope about the macro environment, as they\u2019re generating cash and giving back to investors without increasing supply. EOG Resources Inc. reiterated a no-growth outlook for this year at Citi\u2019s global energy conference earlier this week, according to the bank. The company also declared a surprise special dividend after generating record cash in the first quarter.See more: Exxon, Chevron Preach Prudence Even as Cash Waterfall ReturnsEarnings EncouragementMeanwhile, first-quarter earnings from 40 U.S. shale drillers were generally positive, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets. Almost 80% of the group beat cash flow per share/Ebitda estimates, analyst Leo Mariani wrote in a note to clients.The cyberattack on Colonial Pipeline Co.\u2019s fuel distribution line along the U.S. Eastern Seaboard didn\u2019t do much damage to refining stocks, as a prolonged shutdown was avoided. The approaching summer driving season and the lifting Covid-19 restrictions are keeping analysts bullish.\u201cWhat we\u2019re calling the \u2018summer of YOLO\u2019 should drive a large-scale recovery in gasoline/jet demand this summer as the U.S. (and hopefully the world) returns to normal,\u201d according to Raymond James. \u201cThis narrative will be very hard to fight,\u201d analyst Justin Jenkins wrote in a note to clients.One cause for concern is inflation. While oil\u2019s generally thought to benefit from rising prices, in this case it raises the specter of a less accommodative U.S. Federal Reserve, which could hurt crude. That, however, isn\u2019t bothering Leigh Goehring. \u201cInflation is a massive, massive positive tailwind\u201d for oil & gas companies, which are \u201casset-heavy,\u201d he said.While rising oil prices have fueled the early stages of an earnings recovery for energy firms, the longer-term outlook is murkier, BMO\u2019s chief investment strategist Brian Belski said earlier this week as he upgraded the sector to market weight from underweight.\u201cSecular supply and demand dynamics for oil will likely make it difficult for the energy sector to sustain any type of outperformance over the longer-term,\u201d he concluded.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=6fad6c2e0d5faecd1c52cf1ab3120e3c8d1532d42f1f92c4c1fc6e129bea1059"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1621157940, "headline": "Axa Buys Stellantis NV, Intel Corp, The Walt Disney Co, Sells Lemonade Inc, Berkshire Hathaway ...", "id": 67891954, "image": "", "related": "EOG", "source": "GuruFocus", "summary": "GuruFocus Article or News written by insider and the topic is about: ", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d92bab3af9e3e120a34ed1b11abdfe183d0aa7967bcbbdc3aed9d013894e4cbb"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1621141730, "headline": "EOG Resources: Shares Pop Higher On $1/Share Special Dividend", "id": 67866330, "image": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1280385662/medium_image_1280385662.jpg", "related": "EOG", "source": "SeekingAlpha", "summary": "On May 6th, EOG announced a sparkling Q1 earnings report.
