The surging demand for data center chips from data center operators, high-performance computing (HPC) applications, gaming, and VR/AR devices due to the coronavirus crisis, is fueling growth for the stock.\n\n\n\nWith a market capitalization of $102.7 billion, the chipmaker has gained 56.5% in the past year, but has lost 11.8% over the past six months.\n\n\n\nAMD, Google Partnership Drives Growth\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, Alphabet's subsidiary Google Cloud announced that it had picked AMD's third-generation data center chip to offer enhanced cloud computing services to its customers. Per the deal terms, Google will utilize AMD's EPYC processors to power a new group of Tau virtual machines (VMs) within Google Cloud.\n\n\n\nAMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su said, \u201cWe designed 3rd Gen AMD EPYC processors to meet the growing demand from cloud and enterprise customers for high-performance, cost-effective solutions with optimal TCO.\u201d\n\n\n\nSu further added, \u201cWe work closely with Google Cloud and are proud they selected AMD to exclusively power the new Tau VM T2D instance which provides customers with powerful new options to run their most demanding scale-out workloads.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe news has sparked enthusiasm among investors and has caused the stock price to surge. (See AMD stock chart on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nNo EC Objection For Xilinx Purchase \n\n\n\nPer an article on thestreet.com, the European Commission (EC) has not raised any objection to AMD\u2019s buyout of Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX). The news is expected to be one of the major catalysts for the recent increase in the share price.\n\n\n\nLast year in October, AMD reached an agreement to buy Xilinx. The deal, which is expected to strengthen AMD\u2019s presence in the data center chip market and increase its overall sales, is expected to close later this year.\n\n\n\nOther catalysts might also generate robust growth in the foreseeable future for the company.\n\n\n\nFSR Launch Expected to Spur Sales\n\n\n\nAMD is set to launch FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) and officially reveal the first supported games on June 22nd. The company aims to boost the performance and image quality in supported games with this new technology. However, the company is yet to disclose further details about it.\n\n\n\nThe developers and publishers have reportedly already been working with AMD on FSR adoption.\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s FSR is expected to compete with NVIDIA's (NVDA) deep learning super sampling (DLSS) image technology, which helps games look better and run smoother.\n\n\n\nThe release is expected to help AMD gain a larger market share of the GPU market.\n\n\n\nHowever, whether the new technology will help AMD penetrate the market remains to be seen, as NVDA's DLSS technology has already grabbed a fair share of the market.\n\n\n\nStrong Industry Projections\n\n\n\nPer a report from IDC, the traditional PC market is expected to grow at 18.2%, with shipments totaling 357.4 million this year. This represents a CAGR of 2.5% from 2020 through 2025.\n\n\n\nAlso, the video gaming industry has been a big pandemic winner, thanks to a surge in engagement from gamers staying indoors. According to a study by Mordor Intelligence, the global gaming market is projected to reach $314.40 billion by 2026, recording a CAGR of 9.64% from 2021 through 2026.\n\n\n\nAccording to a report from MarketsandMarkets, the global data center power market is expected to reach $26.1 billion by 2025, indicating a CAGR of 6.4% during the period 2020 to 2025.\n\n\n\nThe strong projections in the personal computer, video gaming, and data center markets are anticipated to spur the demand for AMD\u2019s chips.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAnalysts\u2019 Views\n\n\n\nThe Wall Street community is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 9 Buys, 7 Holds, and 1 Sell. The AMD average analyst price target of $106.54 implies 26% upside potential from the current levels.\n\n\n\nFollowing the AMD and Google Cloud news announcement, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and a price target of $135. This implies 59.6% upside potential to current levels.\n\n\n\nMosesmann said, \u201cAMD's EPYC 3 is in its early days of volume ramp, and we expect significant share gains in the next several years on superior architectural roadmap and scalability.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe further added, \u201cWe believe AMD deserves a premium P/E multiple on the premise of a CPU/GPU share gain, and dollar content expansion story is multiyear in nature. We see earnings power of over $4.50 in 2022, and over $5.50 in 2023.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn June 11, Northland Securities analyst Gus Richard reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and a price target of $116.00. This implies 37.2% upside potential to current levels.\n\n\n\nRichard commented, \u201cIn notebooks, AMD's revenue share is growing faster than its unit share. We expect an increasing mix of corporate notebook revenue to drive client revenue growth in 2H. AMD's server market share accelerated in Q1 and AMD launched its 7nm server chip in Q1 that will likely accelerate share gains in 2H. We believe AMD is getting ample capacity from TSMC, and high-end AMD systems will be the least likely to suffer from component shortages.\u201d\n\n\n\nTipRanks Vital Metrics\n\n\n\nTipRanks data shows that financial blogger opinions are 87% Bullish on AMD, compared to a sector average of 69%.\n\n\n\nTipRanks\u2019 Stock Investors tool shows that investors currently have a Very Positive stance on Advanced Micro Devices, with 3.2% of investors increasing their exposure to AMD stock over the past 30 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated News :Orphazyme (ORPH) Share Price Rose By Almost 61%; What are the Catalysts?Alfi Surges 104% After Signing Agreement with All-NiterWhy is AST SpaceMobile Trading to the Moon?", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4c1058293fef9b2bd5a1fd780dc556c5987033546c399c38d0bb1d0c25596f2e"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1624002300, "headline": "3 Chip Stocks That Would Benefit From Government Subsidies", "id": 68357154, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?2103415599", "related": "AMD", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "The Senate recently passed the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, which would grant $52 billion in subsidies to the U.S. semiconductor industry.

Should investors be worried about this underwhelming showing? Not according to the semiconductor giant. In fact, going by the company\u2019s latest actions, quite the opposite.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, AMD announced an unprecedented share-repurchase program. Over an unspecified period, the company will buy back $4 billion\u2019s worth of stock - funded in its entirety by cash generated from operations.\n\n\n\nAnd the company is sitting on plenty of it by now. The company saw out 2020 with $2.29 billion of cash in the coffers and short-term investments, the most it has had since 2009.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s more, AMD generated free cash flow (FCF) of $777 million in 2020, far above the $276 million the company produced in 2019. Prior to that, since 2011, the company hadn\u2019t reported positive cash flow for a fiscal year.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, Deutsche Bank\u2019s Ross Seymore excepts AMD to generate ~$3-3.5 billion in annual FCF from 2021 to 2023. Over that 3yr period, the $4 billion repurchase plan should represent ~40% of FCF. Seymore also notes that this first large return of cash to shareholders indicates AMD\u2019s \u201cconfidence in its ability to continue generating solid free cash flow (FCF) for the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOverall,\u201d the 5-star analyst further said, \u201cWe expect the market to view this share repurchase announcement favorably as it illustrates AMD\u2019s confidence in its future prospects despite recently rising investor concerns regarding intensifying competition.\u201d\n\n\n\nMirroring AMD\u2019s confidence, Wells Fargo\u2019s Aaron Rakers thinks the aforementioned intensifying competition is less of a concern to AMD and believes the announcement \u201clikely reflects AMD's confidence on executing on its technology roadmap, as well as it maintains/improves its competitive positioning vs. Intel.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat does the rest of the Street make of AMD\u2019s prospects? The ratings are a mixed bag, tilting in the bulls\u2019 favor. Based on 9 Buys vs. 7 Holds and 1 Sell, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average price target is more conclusive; at $106.14, the shares are anticipated to appreciate by 37% over the coming months.

"source": "Yahoo", "summary": "After falling in three-straight sessions despite new all-time highs on Monday, equities found their footing and rallied on Thursday. Will the momentum last into the weekend or is it just a dead-cat bounce? With all of that in mind, let\u2019s look at some top stock trades for Friday. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Tesla (TSLA) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been stalling lately, working on its fourth-straight daily decline and its eighth decline in the past nine trading sessions. CEO Elon Musk\u2019s comments toward Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) don\u2019t seem to be helping either. In any regard, shares are breaking below this week\u2019s low, as well as the 200-day moving average.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips This would be a natural spot for bulls to push for a reversal and given the bounce we\u2019re seeing from the lows, it\u2019s clear that\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to do. If they can, look for Tesla to reclaim the 200-day moving average. Confirmation would come on a daily-up reversal over Thursday\u2019s high. 7 Great Growth Stocks to Consider for Your Short List If they can\u2019t trigger a reversal, Tesla may need to go lower. In that case, let\u2019s see if we get a test of the March lows near $539 and a test of the 50-week moving average. If that doesn\u2019t provide a bounce, the $500 breakout area may be in play. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: AMD (AMD) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) continues to do well from a business standpoint, but unfortunately, nobody really cares about that right now. AMD is considered a growth stock, and growth stocks are getting slammed. Shares are testing into \u2014 and are actually breaking below \u2014 range support near $74. I would love to see the stock hold this mark by the end of the week. If it doesn\u2019t, it runs the risk of becoming resistance. A notable move lower could put the 21-week moving average in play. On a rebound back over $74, look for AMD stock to test into the 10-week moving average, then challenge $80. Above all of these marks puts $87 on the table. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Canada Goose (GOOS) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Canada Goose (NYSE:GOOS) is getting hit hard on Thursday, down almost 9% after reporting earnings. The stock has faded below a number of key moving averages and knifed right through its 21-week moving average on the day. However, it\u2019s finding buyers at the April lows. If this area ends up holding, I want to see GOOS stock reclaim its 21-week moving average. If it can do that, buyers can consider a long position against the post-earnings low. Back above $40 and its 10-week and 50-day moving averages are some reasonable upside targets. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy as Janet Yellen Talks Rate Hikes However, if Canada Goose fails to hold the April low and pushes lower, the gap-fill near $36 and the 200-day moving average may be in the cards. Stay nimble and remain open-minded here. Top Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Sonos (SONO) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO) is also on the move after earnings, up more than 7% on the day. However, it\u2019s been a wild mover on Thursday. There\u2019s good and bad with this chart. For instance, the stock filled its gap at $32.88 earlier this week. However, it then broke below that low with Wednesday\u2019s decline. But then on Thursday shares went daily-up and undid a lot of damage. Then the stock faded from the highs, though. Like I said, it\u2019s a mixed bag here. On the plus side, the stock is well off the lows. Unfortunately, though, Thursday\u2019s fade came from a notable area. Specifically, the $35 area continues to act as resistance, while the 21-week moving average didn\u2019t do SONO stock any favors. This area was also strong support earlier this year and it was the breakdown spot this week. I want to see Sonos reclaim $35 before trusting on the long side. If it does, we have a nice low to measure against. If the stock doesn\u2019t reclaim $35 and breaks that low, it could put another gap-fill in play near $28, followed by the 200-day moving average.

We now have conditions like we\u2019ve never traded through before. Most notably is how big a role the U.S. Federal Reserve is playing in equity markets. They have developed a third unofficial mandate to also prop equity markets. As a result, the indices won\u2019t quit rallying, even when it feels like a bearish day. One sector rests and another one makes a new high. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is one of the stars up 100% in a year. Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com That\u2019s twice as much as its main rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is the third rival languishing red for the same period. Critics complain about Nvidia\u2019s traditional fundamental metrics being too high. They probably feel a bit vindicated since it has sharply corrected since mid-April. In total, it fell 14% from high to this week\u2019s low. Nevertheless, it is still holding well enough, so there is no need to sound panic alarms yet.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips I get it. These persistent altitudes make it difficult to invest with confidence. On long-term charts, it still looks too high to inspire bullish appetites. Therefore, any upside bets right now should come with moderate conviction at best. Having said that, betting against it is absolute lunacy. NVDA stock spent eight months consolidating below $560 per share. As long as price is above that, the whole zone is excellent support. 7 Stocks to Buy Right Now With All Eyes on Crypto Moreover, the company\u2019s fundamentals are an even better defense for the stock price. This is not a not a cheap company by any means. But that\u2019s not an attribute I look for in one that grows this fast. The value of this stock lies in the company\u2019s incredible performance. They are reinventing the way the world computes, which can\u2019t come cheap. A Lot Going for NVDA Stock Source: Charts by TradingView Nvidia has a P/E of 85 and a price-to-sales of 22. That\u2019s almost three times more expensive than AMD and widening. They are both champions among the chip companies. \u201cCheap\u201d is not always smart because you get what you pay for. Those who chose Intel stock at a bargain literally got nothing for it in a year. Conversely, NVDA stock delivered a double win during the same time. Strategically, the experts agree that they now have a material advantage, so it has a position of power. They are driving the trends of computer brain-power and everyone else is following. Gone are the days of it being a graphics card company. Management will report earnings in a few weeks, so we will learn more about their progress. I am very confident that they will deliver excellent numbers. I am also equally as confident that we won\u2019t know which way the stock will go that morning. The price driver on the headline comes from human emotions not facts. Case in point, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported its best quarter ever and the stock fell 10%. Emotions Are Running High Investors are more emotional these days than ever. Maybe this comes from the ongoing battle between Wall Street and Main Street on Reddit. There is a new breed of trader mentality that is relentless in the pursuit of their stocks. This is exaggerating the rotation between the Nasdaq and the small-cap stocks. The point is that NVDA stock falls through no fault of its own. It moves with the prevailing meme, not from fundamental reasons. Value is not a problem and dips to $550 per share are buying opportunities. This was a level I marked as pivotal on the chart back in December. If the markets correct sharply, buying Nvidia stock at $480 will be a gift for a generation. If 2020 taught us anything it is to expect the impossible, so remain humble with the opinions. Back in 2018, Nvidia fell 50% from $280 per share. The more surprising part was that it couldn\u2019t find buyers even at $120 per share. At $280 the experts were absolutely sure that it was a buy. Yet, it lost half its value and there were no loud calls to step in at the bottom. Even if we know the value of something it doesn\u2019t mean that its price will appreciate. At these heights, it is a good idea to limit our conviction levels. To put it simply, leave room for error. The biggest price driver for stocks is the Fed\u2019s QE. This could come to a screeching halt if we continue to have strong jobs reports. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell last week told us he needed loose monetary policy to create jobs. Well, if we get the jobs, then the reason goes away \u2013 and the taper comes. We all remember what happens when the market throws a taper tantrum.

Considering the share price is up an astounding 2,198% over the last five years, it is disconcerting to have witnessed an 11%-plus drop since 2021 kicked off. That raises the question, should investors buy the dip or head for the exits? Fierce Competition In The Sector Much of AMD's recent progress has been at the expense of its competitor, Intel (INTC). At the same time, developments related to INTC account for some of the recent weakness in AMD. Intel recorded a small gain in the CPU market in the fourth quarter, and new CEO Pat Gelsinger is viewed by many as the right man to turn Intel around. AMD is also facing renewed competition from NVIDIA (NVDA). In the middle of this month, NVIDIA introduced the Grace CPU chip. Designed specifically for use in data centers, NVIDIA claims Grace will deliver ten times the current performance on servers devoted to artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) tasks. Moreover, NVIDIA\u2019S graphics processing units (GPUs) were adding market share even before Grace's debut. Robust Growth At AMD Even so, AMD posted stellar quarterly numbers this week, and there are reasons to believe the firm will experience robust growth for the foreseeable future. The company reported a 93% increase in net revenue year-over-year. Digging deeper, its Computing and Graphics segment revenue increased 46% year-over-year, and its Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-custom segment revenue grew 286% year-over-year. (See Advanced Micro Devices stock analysis on TipRanks) Plus, at a time when many in the semiconductor industry were plagued with chip shortages, AMD reported a jump in inventory, with an increase from $1.4 billion in the previous quarter to $1.7 billion currently. AMD also boasts a strong balance sheet, with cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments of $3.1 billion. Its long-term debt is at $313 million. Wall Street Weighs In Following the earnings call, Raymond Janes analyst Chris Caso initiated coverage of AMD with an Outperform rating and a price target of $100. Caso predicts AMD will retain an advantage in CPUs through at least 2024. Shortly thereafter, additional analysts boosted their prices for the stock, with the average analyst price target of $106.14 implying 30% upside potential. According to TipRanks' consensus breakdown, 9 analysts have recommended a Buy, 6 have rated it a Hold, and 1 rates it a Sell. Upbeat Industry Projection Perhaps of greatest importance, particularly for those concerned with the company\u2019s growth trajectory, is management\u2019s guidance for revenue growth of 50% in 2020. That represents an increase from prior guidance of approximately 37%. One reason behind the upbeat projection is an expectation of growth in the data center, personal computer and video gaming markets. According to a study by EMR, the latter is projected to grow at a CAGR of 9% from 2021 through 2026. Meanwhile, a study by MarketersMEDIA projects a CAGR of 4.8% for the data center server market from 2020 through 2025, and IDC forecasts 18.2% growth in the global PC market in 2021. Xilinx Purchase A Boon To AMD Late last year, AMD reached an agreement to buy Xilinx (XLNX). Expected to close late this year, the acquisition will increase overall sales by a third. The deal should also strengthen AMD\u2019s presence in the data center chip market. While AMD\u2019s forward P/E ratio of 30.46 may cause some to pause, it stands as one of the lowest P/E multiples for the company since late 2017. As a matter of fact, during most of the last decade, the company\u2019s P/E ratio has been at least two times that figure. AMD\u2019s PEG ratio of 1.41, which is well below the sector average of 2.08, indicates the shares are likely trading for a significant discount. An evaluation of the stock presents a reasonable likelihood of continued growth for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the acquisition of Xilinx, along with the firm\u2019s strong financial foundation, supports the argument for investing in AMD. Concluding Thoughts For those who give credence to management\u2019s growth projections, the recent sell-off in the shares represents an opportunity to grab a high growth stock at a relatively reasonable valuation.

At the same time, developments related to INTC account for some of the recent weakness in AMD.\u00a0Intel recorded a small gain in the CPU market in the fourth quarter, and new CEO Pat Gelsinger is viewed by many as the right man to turn Intel around.AMD is also facing renewed competition from NVIDIA (NVDA).\u00a0In the middle of this month, NVIDIA introduced the Grace CPU chip.\u00a0Designed specifically for use in data centers, NVIDIA claims Grace will deliver ten times the current performance on servers devoted to artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) tasks.\u00a0Moreover, NVIDIA\u2019S graphics processing units (GPUs) were adding market share even before Grace's debut.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robust Growth At AMDEven so, AMD posted stellar quarterly numbers this week, and there are reasons to believe the firm will experience robust growth for the foreseeable future.\u00a0The company reported a 93% increase in net revenue year-over-year.Digging deeper, its Computing and Graphics segment revenue increased 46% year-over-year, and its Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-custom segment revenue grew 286% year-over-year. (See Advanced Micro Devices stock analysis on TipRanks) Plus, at a time when many in the semiconductor industry were plagued with chip shortages, AMD reported a jump in inventory, with an increase from $1.4 billion in the previous quarter to $1.7 billion currently.\u00a0\u00a0AMD also boasts a strong balance sheet, with cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments of $3.1 billion. Its long-term debt is at $313 million.\u00a0\u00a0Wall Street Weighs InFollowing the earnings call, Raymond Janes analyst Chris Caso initiated coverage of AMD with an Outperform rating and a price target of $100.\u00a0 Caso predicts AMD will retain an advantage in CPUs through at least 2024.Shortly thereafter, additional analysts boosted their prices for the stock, with the average analyst price target of $106.14 implying 30% upside potential. According to TipRanks' consensus breakdown, 9 analysts have recommended a Buy, 6 have rated it a Hold, and 1 rates it a Sell.Upbeat Industry ProjectionPerhaps of greatest importance, particularly for those concerned with the company\u2019s growth trajectory, is management\u2019s guidance for revenue growth of 50% in 2020.\u00a0That represents an increase from prior guidance of approximately 37%.\u00a0\u00a0One reason behind the upbeat projection is an expectation of growth in the data center, personal computer and video gaming markets.\u00a0\u00a0According to a study by EMR, the latter is projected to grow at a CAGR of 9% from 2021 through 2026. Meanwhile, a study by MarketersMEDIA projects a CAGR of 4.8% for the data center server market from 2020 through 2025, and IDC forecasts 18.2% growth in the global PC market in 2021.\u00a0\u00a0Xilinx Purchase A Boon To AMDLate last year, AMD reached an agreement to buy Xilinx (XLNX).\u00a0Expected to close late this year, the acquisition will increase overall sales by a third.\u00a0 The deal should also strengthen AMD\u2019s presence in the data center chip market.\u00a0\u00a0While AMD\u2019s forward P/E ratio of 30.46 may cause some to pause, it stands as one of the lowest P/E multiples for the company since late 2017.\u00a0As a matter of fact, during most of the last decade, the company\u2019s P/E ratio has been at least two times that figure.\u00a0\u00a0AMD\u2019s PEG ratio of 1.41, which is well below the sector average of 2.08, indicates the shares are likely trading for a significant discount.\u00a0\u00a0An evaluation of the stock presents a reasonable likelihood of continued growth for the foreseeable future.\u00a0Furthermore, the acquisition of Xilinx, along with the firm\u2019s strong financial foundation, supports the argument for investing in AMD.\u00a0Concluding ThoughtsFor those who give credence to management\u2019s growth projections, the recent sell-off in the shares represents an opportunity to grab a high growth stock at a relatively reasonable valuation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Disclosure: On the date of publication, Chuck Walston had a position in AMD.Disclaimer:\u00a0The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.
