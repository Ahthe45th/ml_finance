Against this backdrop, the stock analysts at BMO are taking their cue from Belski, and choosing their top picks for 2021. Using TipRanks\u2019\u00a0Stock Comparison tool, we lined up the three alongside each other to get the lowdown on what the near-term holds for these top picks.Tronox, Ltd. (TROX)We will start with Tronox, a mining and specialty metal manufacturing company. Tronox mines titanium ores and zircon, which are used to produce titanium chemicals: titanium dioxide and chemical sands, primarily, which are used in dyes. Tronox products are found in paints, papers, plastics, and other common products. Useful byproducts of the manufacturing process include caustic soda, gypsum, iron sulfate, and various acid compounds.A solid industrial niche, with essential products in a variety of sectors, gives Tronox a firm foundation for growth, and the share value reflects that. The stock rose an impressive 106% over the past 12 months. In Q3, the last reported, Tronox showed $675 million at the top line, up 17% sequentially. Improved market demand, and consequent improved TiO2 (titanium dioxide) sales through the quarter powered the higher revenues.Looking ahead, Tronox has recently issued new Q4 guidance \u2013 and these preliminary numbers were far better than expected. For the last quarter of CY20, Tronox is guiding toward revenue of $783 million \u2013 which will be a 13.6% year-over-year gain.Based on all that Tronox has going for it, BMO analyst John McNulty tells investors that his bullish thesis remains very much intact.\u201cWe listed TROX as one of our top picks for 2021 [based on] our belief that the strength of the cycle would surprise investors in the near term on the volume side and in the intermediate term on the pricing side. The 4Q \"blowout\" supports our near-term thesis while\u2026 recent price hikes give us greater confidence in our intermediate-term thesis as well as our belief that our 2021 and 2022 estimates are solidly too low. We continue to believe TROX offers the most upside of any name in our space looking out through 2021,\u201d McNulty commented. Unsurprisingly, McNulty gives Tronox an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and a $23 price target. This conveys his confidence in TROX's ability to rise 36% over the next twelve months. (To watch McNulty\u2019s track record, click here)What does the rest of the Street think? As it turns out, 3 out of 4 analysts that have published a recent review see the stock as a Buy, making the consensus rating a Strong Buy. Meanwhile, the $19 average price target indicates ~13% upside potential. (See TROX stock analysis on TipRanks)Netflix, Inc. (NFLX)Netflix hardly needs any introduction. It's one of the famous FAANG stocks, a group of tech companies whose sheer size and rate of growth have helped to power the markets over past few years. The FAANGs include Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Google \u2013 so Netflix is in good company, even if its $239 billion market cap puts it in a distant fifth place for size behind its peers.Revenue has grown steadily in every quarter for the past two years, reaching $6.64 billion in 4Q20. That wasn\u2019t the only good news from Q4. The company reported that it had exceeded 200 million paid subscribers in the quarter, and is now looking forward to turning cash flow positive for the first time. On the balance sheet after Q4, Netflix has $15 billion in debt and $8.2 billion in cash on hand. As long as the company turns out hits like \u2018The Queen\u2019s Gambit\u2019 and \u2018The Midnight Sky,\u2019 which had 68 million and 72 million viewers respectively in their first four weeks, the debt is considered sustainable.Analyst Daniel Salmon, rated 5-stars by TipRanks, rates Netflix as Outperform (i.e. Buy) in his recent note for BMO. Salmon gives the stock a $700 price target, implying an upside of 30% for 2021. (To watch Salmon\u2019s track record, click here)Describing Netflix as a \u2018Top Pick\u2019 in his headline, the analyst goes on to say: \u201cWe raise our ARPU estimates driven by recent price increases, leading to higher revenue estimates [...] While the pricing increases may slow the subscriber growth somewhat, we do not anticipate similar level of churns as in 2019 and think total subs can surprise to the upside in 2021. We think there is another leg as the FCF generation becomes reality, and we continue to like the lack of antitrust/regulatory overhang versus rest of FANG.\u201d There are plenty of Buy ratings for Netflix amongst Salmon's colleagues \u2013 23, in fact. With the addition of 6 Holds and 3 Sell, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average price target stands at 632.90 and implies ~17% upside for the foreseeable future. (See NFLX stock analysis on TipRanks)Corteva (CTVA)The third stock on BMO's top picks list, Corteva, was once the agricultural unit of the chemical giant Dupont, before being spun off as an independent company in mid-2019. The company currently boasts a market cap of $30.3 billion \u2013 making it the world\u2019s largest aggrotech company.Corteva fuels its growth through a diverse product line, including seeds, crop protection, and digital land management, all designed to improve crop yields and acre value. Corteva\u2019s seed lines include such staples as corn, wheat, soy, and sorghum \u2013 all of which are either eaten directly, shifted into processed foods, or used as livestock feed. Land management is essential to all aspects of farming, at all scales, from wheat farmers to dairy and meat producers.The third calendar quarter is Corteva\u2019s slowest, and Corteva showed year-over-year declines in earnings and revenue. At the same, the 52-cent EPS and the $1.86 billion reported revenue both beat the analyst forecasts.Watching Corteva for BMO, Joel Jackson writes, \u201cOur favorite idea for 2021 is CTVA\u2026 There's a strong pathway if 13-14x multiples keep rolling forward to future years as CTVA continues to penetrate deeper into seed traits\u2026 we believe 2021 could be a much stronger year for CTVA, which could deliver 20%+ EBITDA growth (we don\u2019t believe this is fully appreciated by the Street although it\u2019s starting to get there). CTVA\u2019s earnings bridge for 2021E could be leaning closer to bull case scenarios as \u2026 higher crop prices provide better seed price opportunities (lower rebates), and crop protection sales fare better than expected.\u201dThese comments support an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and Salazar\u2019s $48 price target suggests that CTVA has room for a 18% upside in the coming year. (To watch Jackson\u2019s track record, click here)All in all, Corteva\u2019s Moderate Buy analyst consensus rating is based on 8 reviews, breaking down to 5 Buys and 3 Holds. The $43.90 average price target suggests room for ~8% upside growth from the current trading price of $40.71.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is expected to announce this month if dicamba-based products can be used next planting season, Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in an Oct. 1 webinar with the Minnesota Farm Bureau. Those products include soybean seeds resistant to the weed killer and the herbicide itself, under brands including BASF SE\u2019s Engenia and Bayer AG\u2019s Xtend.\u201cWe haven\u2019t had this situation we have this year where there\u2019s this uncertainty on whether or not they\u2019re going to be able to apply dicamba over the top of soybean crops,\u201d Michael Frank, who heads Nutrien Ltd.\u2019s Ag Solutions business, said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s creating anticipation to see what EPA is going to do.\u201dU.S. crop farmers are in the middle of harvest, gathering information on yields and whether herbicides proved effective for soybean growth in the U.S., whose output is second only to Brazil. It\u2019s also when they start deciding which agricultural chemicals to bet on for next season, affecting sales in the world\u2019s $60-billion crop-chemical industry -- raising the stakes of the EPA\u2019s decision.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit earlier this year blocked the herbicide, arguing that the EPA ignored risks associated with the chemical drifting onto other properties and violated federal regulations when it extended licensing in October 2018 for two years. The agency criticized and later undercut the court decision, which has canceled registration for three dicamba-based products sold by BASF, Bayer and Corteva Inc.U.S. farmers will harvest 82.3 million acres of soybeans for the 2020-2021 crop year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates. USDA data show 94% of soybeans planted in the U.S. in 2020 are genetically modified specifically to tolerate herbicides.The American Farm Bureau Association and other industry groups advocated for continued dicamba use, arguing that most crop farmers are already familiar with it and switching to other products could jeopardize yields. Others take issue with the chemical\u2019s level of so-called volatility, a key factor for whether it could vaporize or run off into soils that don\u2019t have resistance to it, potentially damaging other crops or causing other harmful effects.For crop-chemical makers, their brands are on the line: if dicamba gets pulled, it could mean discounting products, managing supply of alternatives and potentially stricter regulation on herbicides that are already approved.Read more: Top Herbicide\u2019s Ban Raises Potential for Backup to Be Barred TooFarmers unwilling to risk buying dicamba on fears it\u2019ll get banned may mull alternatives including 2,4-D, the active ingredient in Corteva\u2019s Enlist line of herbicides. It\u2019s among the most commonly used products and, like dicamba, is often grouped with two other chemicals -- glysophate and glufosinate -- to protect seeds from a greater variety of weeds.Growers would see 2,4-D as a viable substitute since it proved comparably effective against dozens of tough weeds, Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein said in an interview. That may help Corteva, even if dicamba ultimately gets approved.\u201cThe longer the EPA waits to make the decision, the more likely it is in my view that farmers switch anyway just due to the uncertainty,\u201d he said. \u201cI think farmers would rather have the certainty of a product even if they haven\u2019t used it before.\u201dCorteva expects industry demand for its Enlist E3 soybean seeds, which are resistant to 2,4-D choline, glyphosate and glufosinate, will climb to more than 30% in 2021, according to company spokesman Gregg Schmidt. That follows this year\u2019s projected 20% share of planted soybean acreage.Nutrien\u2019s Frank said he sees sales of Enlist soybeans increasing in 2021, though if the ban ends next year\u2019s bestsellers will likely be Bayer\u2019s Xtend line of products.One chemical-resistant seed by Bayer, XtendFlex, already received final approval in September for use next year in the U.S. and Canada. The product allows tolerance to both dicamba and glufosinate, a chemical that has become popular in recent decades because of its effectiveness against newer strains of weeds that developed with the rise of genetically modified seeds. Bayer expects XtendFlex to cover 20 million soybean acres next year.If the EPA rules against dicamba, Bayer plans to compensate farmers who bought its dicamba products, including as much as $7 off each unit of some soybean seeds and $40 off each unit of certain cotton seeds resistant to the herbicide. Bayer is willing to make such provisions despite being \u201cvery confident\u201d on future prospects of its dicamba-based XtendiMax, product manager Alex Zenteno said in an interview.\u201cWe\u2019re willing to put a program down to help growers get that confidence if they\u2019re feeling uncertain or unsure, or considering other options,\u201d she said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=46d00e7992960bb6632cbc6363c3f54e0f2fc694658a1a42b90e214c3c86384b"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1602670800, "headline": "Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday", "id": 60662255, "image": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/og_image_social_share_1200x630/sites/all/themes/bz2/images/bz-icon.png", "related": "CTVA", "source": "Benzinga", "summary": "\u00a0\nDuring Wednesday's morning session, 143 companies made new 52-week highs.\nPoints of Interest:\n\nThe largest company by market cap to set a new 52-week high was Thermo...", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=53fa46cef37b4937ff4bd15fb2fa87331e44b5a6da8435b6311202b2288213de"}, {"category": "company news", "datetime": 1602609480, "headline": "We See Green Shoots for Corteva", "id": 55623287, "image": "", "related": "CTVA", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "The agriculture science company has an upside breakout on the charts, and here's how to approach it.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4518271caed5bb7e0dd4ecf23822fc96649bba4545958056eb1a4b023716d4bb"}, {"category": "company news", "datetime": 1602586883, "headline": "What Kind Of Shareholders Hold The Majority In Corteva, Inc.'s (NYSE:CTVA) Shares?", "id": 55623288, "image": "", "related": "CTVA", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "The big shareholder groups in Corteva, Inc.

Roughly $1 billion of that is expected to be realized this year.Despite that progress, Corteva has failed to bring margins and earnings in line with peers, Smith said.\u201cWe all think Corteva is a business that should achieve long-term success,\u201d Smith said at the 13D Monitor Active-Passive Investor Summit. \u201cDespite our positive long-term outlook, the company has not yet lived up to its potential.\u201dCorteva\u2019s FocusCorteva completed its spinoff last year from DowDuPont Inc. The company said in a statement it was focused on its current strategy while it navigates the impact on its business from the outbreak of the coronavirus.\u201cCorteva engages in regular communication with its shareholders, and we welcome continued engagement with Starboard Value and hearing their perspectives related to enhancing shareholder value,\u201d it said in the statement.Smith noted that Corteva\u2019s 2019 Ebitda margin of 14.4% trails its peers, and argued the company should bring those numbers up to about 23%, roughly in line with its competitor, Bayer CropScience Ltd. With that level of improved execution, the company could see its shares trading at $47 to $55, he said.Corteva rose 5.8% to $32.30 at 2:47 p.m. Thursday in New York trading, giving the company a market value of $24 billion.Takeover PotentialSmith said there are similar opportunities at ON Semiconductor, which he argued could be an attractive takeover target as well. The company also has an opportunity to bring in a new leader to oversee the necessary changes with CEO Keith Jackson stepping down in May 2021.Smith said the company should shrink its manufacturing footprint, outsource some of its fabrication work, and potentially explore a sale.\u201cWe believe it\u2019s a great time to invest in an industry leader that has opportunity for margin and growth improvement, trades at a steep discount to peers and could potentially be a strategic M&A target,\u201d Smith said.A representative for On Semiconductor wasn\u2019t immediately available for comment.On Semiconductor\u2019s shares rose 10% to $25.78 at 2:47 p.m., giving the company a market value of $10.6 billion.(Updates with company comment in fifth paragraph.
