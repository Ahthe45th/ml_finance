The weekly unemployment claims report and the Philadelphia Fed business outlook report for June will be released today.\n\n\n\nS&P, Dow, and Nasdaq futures were in red at the time of writing, with 0.3%, 0.2%, and 0.4% lower trading, respectively.\n\n\n\nCommercial Metals Company (CMC), Jabil Circuit (JBL), and Kroger Company (KR) are expected to report earnings before the market opens, while Dynagas LNG Partners LP (DLNG), Adobe (ADBE), and Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc. (SWBI) are expected to report after the market close.\n\n\n\nMidatech Pharma Plc (MTP) was the most actively traded stock in pre-market trading. Recently, the R&D biotechnology company, which is focused on improving the bio-delivery and biodistribution of medicines, disclosed breakthrough in vitro data. The data reflects Q-Sphera\u2019s capability in the formulation of proteins into long-acting injectable products, along with progress across multiple other programs. Per the company, these results offer opportunities for its Q-Sphera technology.\n\n\n\nKULR Technology Group Inc (KULR) was the biggest gainer in pre-market trading as the stock jumped 65.2% at the time of writing. Recently, the developer of next-generation lithium-ion battery safety and thermal management technologies revealed that it has been granted special permission by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DoT) to transport the prototype lithium cells and batteries aboard cargo aircrafts.\n\n\n\nThe special permit authorizes the manufacture, mark, sale, and use of KULR's specially designed packaging for the transportation of prototype lithium cells and batteries. It also permits them to transport prototype lithium cells and batteries contained in or packed with equipment, the company said.\n\n\n\nKULR\u2019s President and COO Keith Cochran said, \u201cKULR's packaging was approved by the US DoT based on its ability to contain potential hazards in the unlikely event that a cell or battery would experience a thermal event. KULR's newly issued special permit allows customers to safely ship prototype batteries that are necessary to advance innovation and contribute to the development of alternative green energy sources.\u201d\n\n\n\nCureVac (CVAC) was the biggest laggard in pre-market trading, as the stock plunged 45.8% at the time of writing. Recently, the clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company disclosed results of its second interim analysis of its international pivotal Phase 2b/3 study in about 40,000 subjects (the HERALD study) of CureVac's first-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidate, CVnCoV. At the interim analysis, CVnCoV reflected only 47% interim vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 disease of any severity, and failed to meet pre-specified statistical success criteria.\n\n\n\nCureVac CEO Dr. Franz-Werner Haas said, \u201cWhile we were hoping for a stronger interim outcome, we recognize that demonstrating high efficacy in this unprecedented broad diversity of variants is challenging. As we are continuing toward the final analysis with a minimum of 80 additional cases, the overall vaccine efficacy may change. In addition, the variant-rich environment underlines the importance of developing next-generation vaccines as new virus variants continue to emerge.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn earnings news, Lennar Corporation (LEN), the home construction company, reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter (ended May 31) results. Net earnings of $2.95 per share surpassed analysts\u2019 expectations of $2.36 per share. It also compares favorably with the net earnings of $1.65 recorded in the same quarter last year.\n\n\n\nRevenues came in at $6.4 billion, beating analysts\u2019 estimates of $5.88 billion and surged 22% from the year-ago period. \u00a0Notably, the company witnessed new orders of 17,157 homes during the quarter, a 32% increase. New home deliveries of 14,493 homes were up 14% year-over-year.\n\n\n\nLennar\u2019s co-CEO Jon Jaffe commented, \u201cWe continue to focus on production costs and cycle times as the homebuilding industry ramps up to meet growing demand. Lennar is uniquely positioned with our size, scale and production oriented Everything\u2019s Included business model to mitigate the well documented industry supply challenges.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn M&A news, Elanco Animal Health (ELAN) will snap up Kindred Biosciences (KIN), a biopharmaceutical company, for $9.25 per share, which represents an approximate value of $440 million. This price signifies a premium of 52% based on the 30-day average.\n\n\n\nThrough this acquisition, Elanco\u2019s expansion plans will speed up its lucrative pet health space, especially in the burgeoning billion-dollar dermatology category. The deal is likely to add an incremental $100 million to the previous innovation revenue guidance range of $500 million to $600 million by 2025, while also offering attractive opportunities thereafter. The acquisition is expected to close during the third quarter of 2021, subject to certain regulatory approvals.\n\n\n\nElanco CEO Jeff Simmons said, \u201cThis highly complementary combination is focused in one of the most exciting spaces in pet health, and one where we see a strategic imperative to build a differentiated competitive offering.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Viavi Solutions (VIAV) proposes to snap up all outstanding subordinate voting shares and multiple voting shares of EXFO Inc for a total value of $430 million. The transaction values the company at $7.50 a share, representing a 103% premium to the June 4 closing price. The price tag also represents a 25% premium to the $6 consideration offered under the \u201cGoing Private Transaction.\"\n\n\n\nIf the merger is consummated, the combined company is likely to be a leader in communications, tests, and measurement over the next decade. Furthermore, the combined entity will be able to invest in opportunistic growth areas while achieving greater operating leverage. However, the proposed merger faces opposition from EXFO\u2019s majority shareholder, Germain Lamonde, who insists not considering any alternative change of control transaction.\n\n\n\nExtended Stay America (STAY), along with its paired-share REIT, ESH Hospitality, Inc., has closed the deal under which they have been acquired by funds managed by Blackstone Real Estate Partners (Blackstone) and Starwood Capital Group. They were acquired for $20.50 per paired share in a cash deal worth $6 billion. In March, an agreement was signed by STAY to be taken private in a 50/50 joint venture between Blackstone Real Estate Partners and private investment firm Starwood Capital Group.\n\n\n\nIn other news, one of the biggest car manufacturers and a global leader in battery and fuel cell technology, General Motors Co., (GM) disclosed an increase in its Electric Vehicle (EV) and Autonomous Vehicle (AV) spending by 75% to $35 billion through 2025.\n\n\n\nGeneral Motors CEO Mary Barra commented, \u201cGM is targeting annual global EV sales of more than 1 million by 2025, and we are increasing our investment to scale faster because we see momentum building in the United States for electrification, along with customer demand for our product portfolio.\u201d", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a68c47e5aca405251e7c7183cdf5f3c656970e63cfb3a099e662c764f2fd3eba"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1623917880, "headline": "Warren Buffet Sold These 8 Stocks in Q1 and All Have Done Well in Q2", "id": 68325847, "image": "https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/berkshire-hathaway-warren-buffett.jpg", "related": "GM", "source": "247WallSt", "summary": "Warren Buffett reduced Berkshire Hathaway's holdings in 13 stocks during the first quarter of this year.

Shares rose 1.6% to close at $61.76 on June 16.\n\n\n\nIn March 2020, GM announced its plans to invest $20 billion in EVs and AVs from 2020 through 2025 to fast-track its transition to electrification. Within a matter of months, the company had increased its planned investment to $27 billion.\n\n\n\nThe current move comes in line with the company\u2019s strategy to become the dominant player in the EV industry in North America. GM aims to achieve this with the help of its Ultium battery platform, HYDROTEC fuel cells, and through Cruise (a unit of GM), to be the first to commercialize self-driving technology at scale. (See GM stock chart on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nMary Barra, the company\u2019s CEO and GM Chair said, \u201cGM is targeting annual global EV sales of more than 1 million by 2025, and we are increasing our investment to scale faster because we see momentum building in the United States for electrification, along with customer demand for our product portfolio.\u201d\n\n\n\nThese aggressive investments are enabled by the company\u2019s strong fundamental business, which includes record EBIT-adjusted in the last three quarters.\n\n\n\nDespite the sector-wide semiconductor shortage, the company continues to garner strong demand for its products, sees better-than-expected results at GM Financial, and has enhanced its near-term production from the pull forward of semiconductors from the third quarter.\n\n\n\nThe company now forecasts 1H21 EBIT to fall in the range of $8.5 - $9.5 billion.\n\n\n\nGM is accelerating its plans to build two new Ultium battery cell plants in the U.S., in addition to the plants already under construction in Ohio and Tennessee.\n\n\n\nOn June 15, GM signed an MOU with Wabtec Corporation to supply Ultium batteries and HYDROTEC fuel cells to aid in building the world\u2019s first 100% battery-powered locomotive.\n\n\n\nThe investments will also accelerate the company\u2019s plans to roll out EVs for retail and fleet customers.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, GM has agreed to provide a multi-year, $5 billion credit facility to its subsidiary Cruise to\u00a0scale its Cruise Origin fleet.\n\n\n\nFollowing the news, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $80, implying 29.5% upside potential to current levels.\n\n\n\nJonas believes that CEO Barra\u2019s comment on better-than-expected second-quarter results will spur investor expectations of $10 of earnings power for full FY2021.\n\n\n\nThe analyst stated, \u201cAnnualizing 1Q results of $2.25 gets us to $9.00. We would not be at all surprised to see GM raise FY guidance by as much as $1/share or more to account for previously unanticipated tailwinds from pricing, mix and other items (GM Financial, international ops, etc).\u201d\n\n\n\nCurrently, the Streets\u2019 estimate for full-year FY21 EPS is pegged at $5.57 per share and around $6.70 per share for FY22 and FY23.\n\n\n\nGM has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 12 Buys and 2 Holds. The GM average analyst price target of $71.43 implies 15.7% upside potential to current levels.

GM will manufacture the vehicle and has started assembling about 100 Origins for testing and validation. At the same time, the automaker is preparing a factory to produce the Origins by the tens of thousands. (See General Motors stock analysis on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nIncluding the credit from GM, Cruise now has more than $10 billion of capital. While that looks like a lot, Cruise CEO Dan Ammann says the amount is necessary, considering the work the company is trying to accomplish.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile I\u2019m incredibly proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished to date, I\u2019m very much humbled by the fact that we\u2019re really just approaching the starting line of what will be the transportation transformation of the century,\u201d said Ammann.\n\n\n\nLast month, Argus Research analyst Bill Selesky reiterated a Buy rating on GM stock and raised the price target to $66 from $62. Selesky\u2019s new price target implies 8.53% upside potential. The analyst says GM has a strong balance sheet now and expects it to resume dividend distribution soon.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"GM continues to diversify its business as it expands into electric and autonomous vehicles. It also benefits from high margins in North America, solid cash flow, and a strong balance sheet,\u201d noted Selesky.\n\n\n\nConsensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 12 Buys and 2 Holds.

(HNST) are expected to report after the market close.\n\n\n\nCatabasis Pharmaceuticals (CATB) was the most actively traded stock in pre-market trading. Recently, the clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company disclosed in its SEC filing that RA Capital Management has acquired about 5.75 million shares, representing 7.5% ownership of the company.\n\n\n\nKindred Biosciences (KIN) was the biggest gainer in pre-market trading as the stock jumped 44.6% at the time of writing. Recently, the biopharmaceutical company agreed to be acquired by Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (ELAN) for $9.25 per share, which represents an approximate value of $440 million.

(ORCL) reported strong results for the fiscal fourth quarter. The company reported quarterly revenues of $11.23 billion, up 8% year-over-year, and surpassed analysts\u2019 expectations of $11.04 billion. The outstanding performance was primarily driven by cloud services and license support revenues, which increased 8% to $7.4 billion.\n\n\n\nOracle reported Q4 adjusted earnings of $1.54 per share, up 29% from the same quarter last year, and beat the consensus estimates of $1.31.\n\n\n\nOracle CTO Larry Ellison commented, \u201cThe world\u2019s two most popular databases are the Oracle Autonomous Database and Oracle MySQL. Independent analysts have tested and confirmed that Oracle MySQL with HeatWave runs 10 to 100 times faster than Amazon's version of MySQL called Aurora. This technological breakthrough is causing several of Amazon's customers to start moving their Aurora workloads to Oracle MySQL. And industry analysts are telling us they are seeing a 10x increase in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customer inquiries. Both the Oracle Autonomous Database and Oracle MySQL with HeatWave technology have captured the technology high-ground in the cloud database business-and that bodes well for the future of the Oracle Cloud.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn M&A news, General Motors (GM) and Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies (Wabtec) (WAB) are likely to enter a partnership deal.

Wabtec's decision to deploy GM's Ultium battery and HYDROTEC hydrogen fuel cell systems further validates our advanced technology and demonstrates its versatility.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn other news, Apple (AAPL) has introduced a new marketplace for premium podcast subscriptions.

It emanates from the benefits seen from GM\u2019s ongoing efforts to prioritize semiconductor usage that maximize the utilization of chips. \n\n\n\nAs an indication of the strong demand, the U.S. assembly plants in charge of the most capacity-constrained GM cars have been instructed not to take any dedicated vacation downtime this summer, the company said. (See\u00a0GM stock analysis\u00a0on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nHowever, management stated that based on the continuing global semiconductor shortage, production at some of its manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia, and South America will continue to be impacted through June and July.\n\n\n\nGM\u2019s VP, North America Manufacturing and Labor Relations, Phil Kienle commented, \u201cThe global semiconductor shortage remains complex and very fluid, but the speed, agility and commitment of our team, including our dealers, has helped us find creative ways to satisfy customers.\u201d\n\n\n\nKienle further added, \u201cCustomer demand continues to be very strong, and GM\u2019s engineering, supply chain and manufacturing teams have done a remarkable job maximizing production of high-demand and capacity-constrained vehicles.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn May 18, Argus Research analyst Bill Selesky reiterated a Buy rating and increased the price target from $62 to $66 (4% upside potential) on the stock.\n\n\n\nSelesky said that the Q1 beat was driven by the successful launch of full-size SUVs, higher-priced full-size pickups, and elevated prices of used vehicles, partially offset by increased raw material and commodity costs. The analyst considers GM to be an attractive investment based on valuation and increased his FY21 EPS estimates.\n\n\n\nOverall, the stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buys and 2 Holds. The average analyst\u00a0price target of $68.67\u00a0implies 8.2% upside potential from current levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated News:Avantor Expands Into China With RIM Bio AcquisitionEsports Entertainment Signs Multi-Year Deal as LAFC\u2019s Esports Tournament Platform ProviderPalantir Technologies Wins United States Special Operations Contract Worth $111M", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=8d23b1c4e1c70839e230846acb9063eaf3e9ebd4cdcc5de51443a0a9019e9bcc"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1622790000, "headline": "General Motors call buyer realizes 18% same-day gains", "id": 67996841, "image": "", "related": "GM", "source": "Thefly.com", "summary": "General Motors call buyer realizes 18% same-day gains GM", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=9b1643b6b23226d6a0121bf68cf2a41494ec26e9a3e24e4bbdfd51f6eae99396"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1622787480, "headline": "General Motors price target raised to $73 from $71 at JPMorgan", "id": 67996842, "image": "", "related": "GM", "source": "Thefly.com", "summary": "General Motors price target raised to $73 from $71 at JPMorgan JPMorgan GM", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=bc861de85f2f3410d624cfc3bbfd69eb15e6778eeab9b9658c0ee625cbb236c1"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1622784672, "headline": "Tesla's China orders fall by nearly half in May - report", "id": 67990191, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2021-06-04T093424Z_1_KV3_RTRLXPP_2_LYNXPACKAGER.JPG?362490347", "related": "GM", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "Tesla Inc's vehicle orders in China nearly halved in May from April, against the backdrop of increased government scrutiny on the U.S. electric carmaker, the Information reported on Thursday, citing internal data.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ea22c65f413e8979935c0dd74ad68ebe4bad770bb987d6189c6087db7bb70ace"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1622773860, "headline": "Asian shares slip, dragged lower by Wall Street tech fall", "id": 67994383, "image": "", "related": "GM", "source": "Associated Press, The", "summary": "Looking for stock market analysis and research with proves results?

The vehicles are to be used by astronauts as a means of transport on the moon's surface. The alliance is part of the two companies' push to enhance deep space exploration.\n\n\n\nWork on the lunar vehicles comes as NASA, through its Artemis program, plans to send humans to the moon to explore and conduct various scientific experiments. The space exploration agency has since contracted General Motors and Lockheed Martin to work on vehicles that can help the astronauts explore the moon's surface even further, focusing on areas humans have never gone.\n\n\n\nGeneral Motors, as a leader in battery technologies, is to leverage its self-driving technology to ensure safer and more efficient transportation on the Moon's surface. Lockheed is to leverage its 50-years of experience in working with NASA as work on the lunar vehicles begins. (See Lockheed Martin stock analysis on TipRanks)\n\n\n\n\"Working together with\u00a0Lockheed Martin\u00a0and their deep-space exploration expertise, we plan to support American astronauts on the Moon once again,\u201d said\u00a0SVP Alan Wexler, Innovation and Growth Unit, General Motors. (See General Motors stock analysis on TipRanks).\n\n\n\nAn autonomous driving system developed by the two companies will allow the rovers to prepare for human landings while also enhancing the range of payloads and experiments.\n\n\n\nArgus analyst Bill Selesky has reiterated a Buy rating on the stock after the company delivered solid first-quarter results. According to the analyst, Q1 earnings underscore the impact of the successful launch of full-size SUVs.
