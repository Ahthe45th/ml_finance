Recently, the oil and gas exploration company postponed the closing date of the business combination transaction with Metamaterial Inc. to June 30, 2021. Notably, the extension of the date gives time for the special Series A Preferred Stock dividend, declared last week, to transpire.\n\n\n\nvTv Therapeutics (VTVT) was the biggest gainer in pre-market trading as the stock jumped 24.2% at the time of writing. Recently, the clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company inked a licensing deal with Cantex Pharmaceuticals. Per the terms of the agreement, Cantex wins exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize azeliragon, vTv\u2019s novel antagonist of RAGE (the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts). \n\n\n\nvTv CEO Steve Holcombe commented, \u201cRAGE is a highly attractive target for the treatment of a wide spectrum of disorders. We believe Cantex is the right partner to further the development of azeliragon, which vTv had studied in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, in new therapeutic indications. They have deep experience in clinical development and the proven capability of repurposing drug candidates for new indications.\u201d\n\n\n\nNew Concept Energy Inc. (GBR) was the biggest laggard in pre-market trading, as the stock plunged around 17.5% at the time of writing. The Dallas-based company, which is focused on the real estate rental business, has no fundamental news in support of the trading sentiment.\n\n\n\nIn M&A news, Uber Technologies (UBER) inked a deal to buy the remaining shares of Cornershop that it does not already own, which is 47%. Upon the deal's close, Uber will own 100% of the grocery delivery start-up and make it its wholly-owned subsidiary. Notably, the company acquired the majority stake in the third quarter of 2020 (except in Mexico, which closed in January 2021).\n\n\n\nThe rest of Cornershop will be acquired in an all-stock transaction, with the issue of 29 million shares of Uber\u2019s stock to the minority Cornershop investors for a purchase price of $1.4 billion. The transaction is expected to close this July.\n\n\n\nUber commented in an SEC filing, \u201cCornershop\u2019s financial results are already fully consolidated in the Company\u2019s financial statements given the Company\u2019s existing majority ownership, therefore no change is expected to the Company\u2019s Gross Bookings, Revenue or Adjusted EBITDA as a result of the transaction.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix (NFLX) and Amblin Partners, the company headed by Steven Spielberg, entered into a strategic partnership to produce multiple new films per year for the streaming platform. Amid stiff competition in the streaming business, the deal is likely to enhance Netflix\u2019s streaming library with promising entertainment options.\n\n\n\nNetflix\u2019s Head of Global Film Scott Stuber commented, \u201cAmblin and Steven Spielberg are synonymous with incredible entertainment. Their passion and artistry combine to make films that both captivate and challenge audiences.\u201d\n\n\n\nWelltower (WELL) announced its intention to purchase Holiday Retirement\u2019s 86-property senior housing folio for $1.58 billion. The transaction is likely to close in the third quarter of this year. Welltower is a real estate investment trust that invests in healthcare infrastructure.\n\n\n\nUpon closing of the transaction, Atria Senior Living, with whom Welltower has inked a deal to manage properties, will acquire Holiday Retirement, attain control of the properties and retain Holiday\u2019s senior management and staff.\n\n\n\nWelltower CEO Shankh Mitra said, \u201cWelltower is thrilled to expand its strong partnership with Atria through the acquisition of this unique platform of assets. John and the Atria team share our vision for the significant, multi-year growth opportunity in the seniors housing sector and we are excited to embark on this journey together.

Being a health fanatic, Ronaldo snubbed the Coca-Cola bottles placed in front of him, preferring water instead.\n\n\n\nWith Cristiano Ronaldo being a global superstar and one of the most influential figures on social media, any action by him is likely to have strong implications.\n\n\n\nTherefore, Ronaldo\u2019s disapproval of the drink led to a decline in the company\u2019s share price in a matter of minutes, wiping out an estimated $4 billion of the brand's value. The stock did, however, manage to recover slightly in late trading. (See KO stock chart on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nBottom Line\n\n\n\nThough the company has been losing market share globally in the ready-to-drink market due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, things have recently started to change.\n\n\n\nThe company has benefitted from the reopening of restaurants and movie theatres in key markets of the U.S. and Europe. This can be seen in the company\u2019s stock price, which has climbed nearly 15% since the start of February.\n\n\n\nHowever, Ronaldo\u2019s condemnation for the unhealthy drink might have left a mark on the minds of youngsters, especially football lovers, be it young or old.\n\n\n\nAnalyst\u2019s View\n\n\n\nOn June 15, Credit Suisse analyst Kaumil Gajrawala reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $62.00 from $60.00. This implies 11.9% upside potential to current levels.\n\n\n\nThe analyst remains positive about the company going forward. He believes the recovery \"should be earlier and faster than planned,\" due to increasing vaccination rates. The analyst expects the company\u2019s estimates to remain above consensus levels.\n\n\n\nThe rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 7 Buys and 4 Holds. The KO average analyst price target of $60.20 implies 8.6% upside potential from current levels. \n\n\n\nTipRanks\u2019 Hedge Fund Trading Activity tool shows that confidence in KO is currently Neutral, as the cumulative change in holdings across all 18 hedge funds that were active in the last quarter was an increase of 653,700  shares.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated News :ContextLogic Inks Partnership Deal with PrestaShop; Shares Pop 12.7%Moderna Submits Authorization Application for Use of COVID-19 Vaccine in Swiss AdolescentsHow Come Petco Health and Wellness Company (WOOF) Stock Is Rallying Today?", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=eaaabe30aaf71a196ed902aebc8f3eb12f82655fb78f6519707e5310840f9b4c"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1623832740, "headline": "Coca-Cola lost $4B in market value after Cristiano Ronaldo snub, BI reports", "id": 68301883, "image": "", "related": "KO", "source": "Thefly.com", "summary": "Coca-Cola lost $4B in market value after Cristiano Ronaldo snub, BI reports KO", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=f6fa9cef46b7b9cd637098211d964dc0a4413d1d98034c4188eb246132d0f840"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1623831741, "headline": "5 Dividend Aristocrats Where Analysts See Capital Gains", "id": 68356638, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?81987791", "related": "KO", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "To become a \"Dividend Aristocrat,\" a dividend paying company must accomplish an incredible feat: consistently increase shareholder dividends every year for at least 20 consecutive years.
