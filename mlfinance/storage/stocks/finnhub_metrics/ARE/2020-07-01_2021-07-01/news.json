(Nasdaq: TCRR), a clinical-stage cell therapy company with a pipeline of novel T cell therapies for patients suffering from cancer, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021 and provided a corporate update. \u201cWe remain on track to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose for gavo-cel in 2021 and advance into the expansion portion of the Phase 1/2 trial where our primary focus will be efficacy as well as continuing to monitor for safety. The clinical benefit we have observed with our cancer patients gave us confidence to expand our manufacturing capabilities by establishing a commercial-scale cGMP facility in Rockville, Maryland, which we expect to come online in 2023,\u201d said Garry Menzel, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of TCR2 Therapeutics. \u201cIn the last quarter we were also able to showcase our early-stage programs in our rich pipeline and reflect on the versatility of our TRuC-T cell platform. This included presenting our CD70-targeted autologous TRuC-T cell and our mesothelin-targeted allogeneic TRuC-T cell at AACR. As for our additional solid tumor milestones in 2021, we expect to present more complete data from the dose escalation Phase 1 portion of the gavo-cel trial, file an IND for TC-510, a mesothelin-targeted TRuC-T cell enhanced with a PD-1:CD28 switch receptor, and present preclinical data on our IL-15 enhancement, which we believe will drive even longer persistence and expression of a memory phenotype, characteristics which could be beneficial across our portfolio.\u201d Recent Developments gavo-cel: TCR2 presented clinical and translational data from the dose escalation portion of the Company\u2019s Phase 1/2 clinical trial of gavo-cel in patients with treatment refractory mesothelin-expressing solid tumors at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Virtual Annual Meeting. The data reported were from eight treatment-refractory mesothelin-expressing solid tumor patients and highlighted translational markers consistent with the clinical profile, including transduction efficiency, CD4:CD8 ratio, memory phenotype, expansion and persistence and cytokines. Early-Stage Pipeline TCR2 presented new preclinical data from its allogeneic \u201coff the shelf\u201d TRuC-T cell targeting mesothelin highlighting a lack of alloreactivity, reduced risk of host rejection, upregulation of activation markers, secretion of cytokines and clearance of tumors comparable to gavo-cel at the AACR Virtual Annual Meeting.TCR2 presented new preclinical data from its TRuC-T cell targeting CD70 highlighting T cell expansion, improved memory phenotype, significant anti-tumor efficacy in multiple xenograft mouse models with no evidence of in vivo fratricide at the AACR Virtual Annual Meeting. Corporate: TCR2 announced that it signed a long-term, full-building lease with Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (NYSE: ARE) for an existing 85,000 square foot cell therapy manufacturing facility in Rockville, Maryland which is ready for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) build-out. The site will support clinical and commercial production of gavo-cel with a capacity that is projected to treat several thousand cancer patients annually. The facility is expected to accelerate the Company\u2019s commercial-scale manufacturing timelines with production anticipated in 2023.TCR2 announced the appointment of Aaron Vernon as Vice President of Technical Operations. Previously, Mr. Vernon held senior positions including Vice President of Global Technical Operations and Vice President of Engineering & Supply Chain at Autolus Therapeutics, where he led manufacturing capacity expansion and overseeing internal and external manufacturing of plasmid, vector and cell therapy products. Anticipated Milestones TCR2 to present additional safety, efficacy and translational data from the Phase 1 portion of the gavo-cel Phase 1/2 clinical trial for patients with mesothelin-expressing solid tumors throughout 2021.TCR2 to present an interim update from the Phase 1 portion of the TC-110 Phase 1/2 clinical trial for patients with CD19+ non-Hodgkin lymphoma or adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the second half of 2021.TCR2 plans to file an IND for TC-510, the first enhanced TRuC-T cell targeting mesothelin with a PD-1:CD28 switch, in the second half of 2021.TCR2 plans to select a development candidate for its allogeneic program in the second half of 2021.TCR2 to present preclinical data on its IL-15 enhancements program in the second half of 2021.TCR2 anticipates production of clinical trial material from ElevateBio LLC and its manufacturing facility in Stevenage, UK, both in anticipation of demand from the Phase 2 expansion trial of gavo-cel, in 2022. Financial Highlights Cash Position: TCR2 ended the first quarter of 2021 with $333.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments compared to $228.0 million as of December 31, 2020. Net cash used in operations was $19.9 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $16.4 million for the first quarter of 2020. TCR2 projects net cash use of $100-110 million for 2021, which includes tenant improvements to the Rockville facility. We expect cash on hand to support operations through 2023.R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses were $15.9 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $12.0 million for the first quarter of 2020. The increase in R&D expenses is primarily related to ongoing clinical trials, increase in headcount and additional lab facilities.G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $5.7 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $4.3 million for the first quarter of 2020. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs.Net Loss: Net loss was $21.5 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $15.5 million for the first quarter of 2020, driven predominantly by increased personnel expenses. Rockville Facility In March 2021, we entered into a lease for a new manufacturing facility. The landlord built an approximately 85,000 square foot rental building in Rockville, Maryland and leased the facility to the Company as a manufacturing facility for an initial term of 15 years through June 2036. Because we are involved in the construction project and are responsible for paying a significant portion of the costs of normal finish work and structural elements of the facility, the Company is deemed for accounting purposes to be the owner of the building during the construction period under build to suit lease accounting guidance under ASC 840, Leases. Therefore, the Company recorded a construction-in-progress asset and a related construction financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of property and equipment and lease financing obligations, respectively. We anticipate lease payments of $1.4 million for the remainder of 2021. About TCR2 Therapeutics TCR2 Therapeutics Inc. is a clinical-stage cell therapy company developing a pipeline of novel T cell therapies for patients suffering from solid tumors or hematological malignancies. TCR2\u2019s proprietary T cell receptor (TCR) Fusion Construct T cells (TRuC\u00ae-T cells) specifically recognize and kill cancer cells by harnessing signaling from the entire TCR, independent of human leukocyte antigens (HLA). In preclinical studies, TRuC-T cells have demonstrated superior anti-tumor activity compared to chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells), while secreting lower levels of cytokine release. The Company\u2019s lead TRuC-T cell product candidate targeting solid tumors, gavo-cel, is currently being studied in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial to treat patients with mesothelin-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ovarian cancer, malignant pleural/peritoneal mesothelioma, and cholangiocarcinoma. The Company\u2019s lead TRuC-T cell product candidate targeting hematological malignancies, TC-110, is currently being studied in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial to treat patients with CD19-positive adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (aALL) and with aggressive or indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

(Nasdaq: TCRR), a clinical-stage cell therapy company with a pipeline of novel T cell therapies for patients suffering from cancer, today announced that it has signed a long-term, full-building lease with Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (NYSE: ARE) for an existing 85,000 square foot cell therapy manufacturing facility in Rockville, Maryland which is ready for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) build-out. The site will support clinical and commercial production of gavo-cel with a capacity to treat several thousand cancer patients annually. The facility is expected to accelerate the Company\u2019s commercial-scale manufacturing timelines with production anticipated in 2023. \u201cAfter observing the consistent early clinical benefit and manageable safety profile experienced by patients treated with gavo-cel, we committed to securing a dedicated U.S. manufacturing facility as the first step in building a regional network to supply cancer patients with our therapies,\u201d said Garry Menzel, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of TCR2 Therapeutics. \u201cLeasing an existing manufacturing footprint is a substantial milestone for TCR2, saving us valuable time and capital so that we can be ready for commercial production in 2023. Our new state-of-the-art facility will allow us to directly leverage our cell therapy process development expertise and control our end-to-end production supply chain. We are very pleased to be building a world-class cell therapy production facility for gavo-cel that will bring new hope to cancer patients suffering from solid tumors.\u201d The 85,000 square foot facility constructed by Alexandria Real Estate Equities will provide space for commercial and clinical manufacturing, quality control laboratories and offices upon completion. TCR2 is designing the state-of-the-art cell therapy facility to utilize semi-automated and functionally closed systems which aim to provide cGMP manufacturing while optimizing the reliability of our cell therapy products and reducing manufacturing costs and vein-to-vein time. The flexible layout will allow production of gavo-cel and other emerging cell therapies in the TRuC-T cell pipeline. \u201cThe hiring of Aaron Vernon to head technical operations for the Company comes at the right time as we expand our manufacturing capabilities in anticipation of commercial production. His prior leadership roles in building out commercial operations as well as his specific expertise in global supply chain management will offer vital insights to TCR2 as we continue to execute upon our clinical strategy for gavo-cel,\u201d added Dr. Menzel. Aaron Vernon joins TCR2 as Vice President of Technical Operations. Most recently, he held senior positions including Vice President of Global Technical Operations and Vice President of Engineering & Supply Chain at Autolus Therapeutics, a clinical stage autologous CAR-T cell therapy company, where he held numerous responsibilities including manufacturing capacity expansion and overseeing internal and external manufacturing of plasmid, vector and cell therapy products. Previously, Aaron was Vice President of Global Supply Chain and Manufacturing at Sucampo Pharmaceuticals. Earlier in his career, served in various engineering and manufacturing operations roles at AstraZeneca, MedImmune and Johnson & Johnson. About TCR2 Therapeutics TCR2 Therapeutics Inc. is a clinical-stage cell therapy company developing a pipeline of novel T cell therapies for patients suffering from solid tumors or hematological malignancies. TCR2\u2019s proprietary T cell receptor (TCR) Fusion Construct T cells (TRuC\u00ae-T cells) specifically recognize and kill cancer cells by harnessing signaling from the entire TCR, independent of human leukocyte antigens (HLA). In preclinical studies, TRuC-T cells have demonstrated superior anti-tumor activity compared to chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells), while secreting lower levels of cytokine release. The Company\u2019s lead TRuC-T cell product candidate targeting solid tumors, gavo-cel, is currently being studied in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial to treat patients with mesothelin-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ovarian cancer, malignant pleural/peritoneal mesothelioma, and cholangiocarcinoma. The Company\u2019s lead TRuC-T cell product candidate targeting hematological malignancies, TC-110, is currently being studied in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial to treat patients with CD19-positive adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (aALL) and with aggressive or indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

Shares closed at $170.59 on Tuesday.Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 0.9 million additional shares. The offering is expected to close by Jan. 8, 2021, subject to closing conditions.The real estate investment trust said that the net proceeds from the offering will be used to finance pending acquisitions, including 401 Park Drive, 201 Brookline Avenue and a related future development opportunity in the heart of the company's Greater Boston life science cluster market. The remaining proceeds will be used for general working capital and other corporate purposes, including the reduction of the outstanding balance on the company's unsecured senior line of credit and commercial paper program.UBS analyst Brent Dilts recently initiated coverage on the stock with a Hold rating and a price target of $166 (2.7% downside potential).According to Dilts, the company's accelerating fundamentals in its core lab/tech markets are offset by slowing demand from the tech and other traditional office tenants that make up 19% of ARE's tenant base. (See ARE stock analysis on TipRanks)Meanwhile, the stock scores a cautiously optimistic outlook from the rest of the Street. The analyst consensus of a Moderate Buy is based on 1 Buy and 1 Hold. The average price target of $175 implies 2.6% upside potential at current levels.Related News:Tuesday\u2019s Pre-Market: Here\u2019s What You Need To Know Before The Market OpensViewRay Prices $50M Public Offering; Shares Drop 13%Brookfield Asset Management To Take Property Unit Private In $5.9B Deal", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=eb634ee91b92caf2791d89bae84c1eddcc0ca0c456155185ccb37830f3a517d5"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1609880160, "headline": "Simon Property Group Inc. stock rises Tuesday, still underperforms market", "id": 62159781, "image": "https://images.mktw.net/im-220105/social", "related": "ARE", "source": "MarketWatch", "summary": "Shares of Simon Property Group Inc. inched 0.43% higher to $83.17 Tuesday, on what proved to be an all-around positive trading session for the stock market,...", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a637532faa6809e16a09269bd818c6140831a7557d190a774913b5a54332b392"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1609874460, "headline": "Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc. stock falls Tuesday, underperforms market", "id": 62156602, "image": "https://images.mktw.net/im-220105/social", "related": "ARE", "source": "MarketWatch", "summary": "Shares of Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc. slipped 0.11% to $170.59 Tuesday, on what proved to be an all-around great trading session for the stock...", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=34603249af0ed8721438fa503e0edc9da559ab2848fa155ffad6382bf3dc5401"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1609840800, "headline": "Validea Peter Lynch Strategy Daily Upgrade Report - 1/5/2021", "id": 62148720, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?199207951", "related": "ARE", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "The following are today's upgrades for Validea's P/E/Growth Investor model based on the published strategy of Peter Lynch.

Polls show the outcome as far from clear, even as big names including Governor Gavin Newsom, billionaire Mark Zuckerberg and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden support its passage.Currently, under the state\u2019s Proposition 13, property taxes on both homes and businesses are limited to 1% of the purchase price and annual assessed taxable valuation increases are capped at 2%.Proposition 13 has long been popular with homeowners and changing it has been considered a third rail in California politics. It not only capped property taxes but made it more difficult to raise other levies too. Its passage in 1978 set off a national wave of other tax limitation measures.Backers of this year\u2019s measure say Proposition 13 has shortchanged schools and created an unequal system benefiting large corporations such as Walt Disney Co., which pays taxes on Disneyland based on the 1970s but charges customers 2020 fees. Switching the assessment to market value, which would take effect starting in 2022, could generate as much as $11.5 billion annually for local governments, schools and community colleges, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office.Opponents say it would increase the cost of living for everyone as businesses would likely pass along the higher levies. They also argue that changing the commercial portion of Proposition 13 is a stepping stone to easing its limits on residential property tax increases.Split RollSurveys from the Public Policy Institute of California and the Berkeley Institute of Government Studies show that the outcome is too close to call, indicative of both the popularity of Proposition 13 and the uncertainty voters feel as they grapple with a pandemic and recession battering state and local finances.\u201cJust the fact that the voters have a willingness to go in and make changes to something that has just become a fundamental aspect of the tax system in California would send a signal that we\u2019re in a different place as a state than we have been in the past,\u201d Mark Baldassare, president and chief executive officer of the Public Policy Institute of California, said about implications of passage.The pandemic-fueled downturn, which resulted in less state funding for schools, underscores the need to adjust the property tax law, said Jeff Freitas, president of the California Federation of Teachers. He pointed to the campaign\u2019s analysis showing that 10% of commercial and industrial properties would generate 92% of the new revenue from the change, called a split roll because it would treat commercial and residential properties differently.\u201cProp 13 was sold as the grandmother that\u2019s going to be evicted. But what happened was corporations are actually the ones that won out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe corporations that are making billions of dollars in the state of California, it\u2019s their time to reinvest in our schools and our communities.\u201dDoing BusinessCalifornians will also weigh a measure expanding rent control and another allowing qualified homeowners who move to save on their property taxes while limiting tax breaks on residences used as rentals. In San Francisco, voters will decide whether to increase the transfer tax rate on all properties valued at $10 million and more.Measures such as Proposition 15 make it more difficult for companies to do business in California, said Eugene F. Reilly, chief investment officer at Prologis Inc., the world\u2019s largest industrial REIT, according to a transcript of an earnings call this month. The San Francisco-based company donated $15,000 to the campaign against the measure, state records show.Reilly said his business can absorb the changes and that California continues to be the center of innovation. Still, \u201cthe politicians are making it very difficult for this economy to remain competitive,\u201d he said.Increased costs of doing business could accelerate the trend of money and people leaving relatively high-tax states such as California, said Joel Marcus, chief executive officer of Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc., a Pasadena-based REIT that invests in laboratory space.\u201cWhen you raise taxes, people think that\u2019s really a great thing because it provides you -- whether it\u2019s the city or the state or even the national government -- with greater resources,\u201d Marcus said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. \u201cBut what they don\u2019t see is what it does is causes flight of capital and flight of talented people, the human capital.\u201d\u2018Significant Threats\u2019Proponents of the campaign have raised $80 million, led by labor unions such as the California Teachers Association and SEIU California State Council. But some prominent businesses show support. Zuckerberg\u2019s foundation, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Advocacy, is a major contributor to the campaign, and Salesforce.com Inc. donated $400,000.Opponents have raised $70 million, led by business and taxpayer groups such as the California Business Roundtable and California Taxpayers Association.\u201cThis certainly ranks as one of the most significant threats to Proposition 13,\u201d said Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, which was founded by the leader of the campaign for the landmark law.Freitas called it a \u201clie\u201d that this year\u2019s measure would lead to dismantling the tax system for homeowners, and said that it would close a \u201cloophole\u201d for corporations. \u201cThere\u2019s no next step,\u201d he said.The Public Policy Institute of California poll showed 49% of likely voters supported the measure while 6% were undecided. Since voters find it easier to say no to propositions, the burden is on the proponents to press their case, Baldassare said.\u201cPeople find tax measures to be very complicated to vote on,\u201d Baldassare said. \u201cParticularly in this time in California, when we\u2019re facing not just one but a multitude of crisis now, voters want to do the right thing. And they\u2019re not quite sure what the right thing is in this case.\u201d(Updates with quotes from REIT chief executive in 14th and 15th paragraphs)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=86fb78d17b3731b8151672c5204158bb15b862aa3d54fcfec78100b77893401a"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1603882800, "headline": "Validea Peter Lynch Strategy Daily Upgrade Report - 10/28/2020", "id": 61110135, "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?1620324471", "related": "ARE", "source": "Nasdaq", "summary": "The following are today's upgrades for Validea's P/E/Growth Investor model based on the published strategy of Peter Lynch.

It's the largest landlord in the US for laboratories and related offices.Its top companies by rent revenues include Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), Celgene, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Merck (NYSE:MRK)--which we own in Profitable Investing--Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), Novartis (NYSE:NVS), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnd those tenants pay. The most recent monthly rent collections were current for 99.4% of all leases. Moreover, Alexandria has 97% of its leases as triple-net.This means nearly all of its life science tenants pay rent as well as taxes, general upkeep and insurance, which significantly reduces risks of unexpected costs and makes for a more dependable portfolio.But it gets even better.Over 95% of leases have locked-end annual agreed base rent escalation agreements. That means, at minimum, Alexandria has inflation and cost control protections for its longer-term leases. And these agreements don't preclude additional rent increases as further negotiated.Then, there is an added additional sweetener: 96% of tenant leases also come with clauses mandating additional capital expenditures (CAPEX) to the properties owned by Alexandria. Alexandria Knows Where the Brains AreThe best and the brightest in the biotech and life sciences are not just scattered here and there. They tend to be clustered around educational and government facilities as well as around others in the \"best and brightest\" category. Alexandria knew this from day one in 1994, with its first major facility.It has clustered properties for single and multiple tenants in Boston, San Francisco, New York, Seattle, San Diego and the Research Triangle in North Carolina, which ties together leading universities and science labs. It's also in suburban Maryland, just outside of DC, thanks to the NIH and other government entities.Now, in the current era of COVID-19, the idea of clustered properties might seem like a big problem as so many folks around the US are remote working and staying away from offices. But this is where biotech and life sciences are unique.There isn't really work-at-home here, as you can't just set up a controlled environment complete with filtered air and water as well as other technologies that are mission-critical for lab work.Even before COVID-19, the lab properties were already set up with stringent air and filter controls well above HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) and MERV-13 (Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value-13) standards. This means that the brainiacs working in Alexandria's lab properties are likely safer at work than at home.For the most recent data, Alexandria has seen revenue growth of 15.4% over the past year. This continues the trend of strong gains in sales, with the three-year average running at 18.9% on a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) basis.Its property and other assets amounting to the company's intrinsic (book) value continue to expand at a CAGR of nearly 12% over the past three years.Alexandria Revenue & Book Value--Source: Bloomberg Finance, L.P.The building of book value is quite impressive because it shows that shareholders are not just getting a higher share price, but a higher actual value in the underlying company. And with revenues gaining by an even greater pace, that means the company is able to make more from its assets at better margins.But what shareholders really care about is the share price. And Alexandria continues to be recognized in the market.The return over the trailing year is 24.3%, including its dividend income. That's more than 33% better than the return of the S&P 500 and compares even better to the S&P Real Estate Index's net loss of 0.6%.Alexandria Real Estate Equities, S&P 500 & S&P Real Estate Indexes Total Returns--Source: Bloomberg Finance, L.P.This outperformance is not just a recent fluke. Over the trailing five years, Alexandria has continued to out-gun the S&P 500 and S&P Real Estate Index by nearly similar margins.Is it too pricey? Nope.The shares are only valued now at 2.3 times book, which is lower than the shares have been valued over the past years. And it's at a discount to the average book value of the Bloomberg US REITs Index members, even more so compared to the average book value of the S&P Real Estate Index, despite Alexandria's continued outperformance.The return on funds from operation (FFO), which measures just the actual return from the rental of its properties, is ample at 11.5%. That's also better than most of its peers.Debt is controlled at only 40.9% of overall capital of the company, and creditors are eager to buy its bonds. The company has been lowering debt costs with refinancing.Moreover, Alexandria has been able to expand its capital for property acquisition and development with equity sales. The company has placed three share sales since June 2019 at market favorable terms that have rewarded both existing shareholders as well as buyers of all of the new shares.The dividend yields 2.4%, which is lower than the average for the bigger REITs, but it's well above the general market average and has been increasing in distribution by an average of 7.5% over the past three years.To get my buy-under price and further guidance on Alexandria Real Estate Equities (NYSE:ARE), sign up to become a Profitable Investing subscriber today.Neil George was once an all-star bond trader, but now he works morning and night to steer readers away from traps -- and into safe, top-performing income investments.

After some 25% of the S&P listed companies have reported Q2 results, the \u2018beat rate\u2019 is over 80%. That compares well to the 65% beat rate last quarter. And with another 184 companies reporting this week, about one third off S&P index, we\u2019ll know by Friday if this trend is solid or not.Either way, however, the high beat rate is an artifact of a low bar, which brings us to the bad news. The COVID-19 epidemic has so reduced expectations that even though stocks are coming in better than forecast, they are still showing serious year-over-year declines in sales and profits. The markets have been forgiving, that is all; the bottom line, however, has been grim in the aftermath of the Q1 economic shutdowns and the unstable recovery in Q2.With this in mind, investors should be more selective in their stock picks, which lead us to look more closely at the \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 stocks from the TipRanks database. Specifically, we\u2019ve pulled up the details on three that are releasing earnings after the markets close today. Let\u2019s find out why they are compelling, and get a hint of what to expect after hours.NXP Semiconductors (NXPI)We\u2019ll start in the tech sector. NXP is an international semiconductor manufacturer, with headquarters located in both Texas and the Netherlands. The company reported $8.9 billion in revenues for 2019, and despite a hit to sales in 1H20 the Q1 numbers came in above expectations.NXP benefits from its position as a supplier of advanced chips for automation and IoT applications. A large portion of the company\u2019s business \u2013 nearly half \u2013 is with the automobile industry, and the company\u2019s products are integral to radar systems and battery monitors. This sets up NXP to take advantage of automotive\u2019s moves toward self-driving and/or electric cars. Another 21% of NXP\u2019s business is with IoT applications.Looking ahead, the forecasts for the company\u2019s Q2 numbers exemplify both the good and bad of the coronavirus era. Wall Street expects to see about 86 cents per share tonight, a sharp drop from the $1.90 reported in Q2 2019, and down sequentially form Q1. At the same time, remember that NXP beat the Q1 forecast by 48%, so don\u2019t be surprised if the forecast now is a lowball that NXP will easily clear.Deutsche Bank\u2019s 5-star analyst Ross Seymore is one of the bulls on NXPI. He rates the stock a Buy, and his $135 price target implies a potential upside of 13%. (To watch Seymore\u2019s track record, click here)Backing his stance, Seymore writes, \u201c[We] would not be surprised to see NXPI slightly beat its 2Q guidance mid-point as demand largely appeared to be better than feared as the quarter progressed. While NXPI\u2019s Auto-heavy exposure (40-50% of revs) may limit the upside in 2Q\u2026 we nonetheless expect the company\u2019s results and likely its 3Q guidance to reflect a solid recovery\u2026 we remain impressed by NXPI\u2019s ability to tightly manage its business throughout the cyclical downturn in 2019 and the COVID pandemic this year, with the resulting lean inventory yielding the potential for meaningful improvement in NXPI\u2019s revenues, GM and EPS as demand normalizes.\u201d Overall, NXPI's Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 17 reviews, including 13 Buys and only 4 Holds. Meanwhile, at $125.94, the average price target suggests a modest upside of 6% from the current trading price of $118.86. (See NXPI stock analysis on TipRanks)Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE)Next on our list is a real estate investment trust with a unique niche. Alexandria Real Estate Equities is heavily involved in the life-sciences industry, owning and leasing office and laboratory space used by research companies. The company boasts a market cap of $24 billion, along with more than 41 million square feet of leasable space. Alexandria has a presence in several major US research hubs, including New York and Boston, and San Diego and Seattle.The value of Alexandria\u2019s niche is clear from the long-term earnings trend. ARE has reported consistently rising quarterly earnings for the last two years, a trend that was enhanced by the COVID-19 epidemic, which put a premium on health and life sciences services. ARE, which had just missed the earnings forecast in Q4, matched it in Q1 at $1.82 per share. Looking ahead, the stock is expected to show a 55% year-over-year earnings gain, based on $253 million in revenue.A measure of Alexandria\u2019s strength can be seen in its stock and dividend actions taken during Q2. The company put 6.9 million shares of common stock on the market, at a price of $160 per share, during June, with the proceeds of the sale funding forward sale agreements and construction on highly leased development projects. In addition, the company raised its dividend by 3 cents, to $1.06 per share. The new dividend gives a yield of 2.5%, and has a \u2018safe\u2019 payout ratio of 49%.JMP Securities analyst Aaron Hecht notes, \u201cSince the COVID-19 lockdown began, we have seen material demand shifts across real property types as the pandemic/social unrest has changed consumer behavior. Demand is increasing across real estate sectors that provide superior safety from COVID-19\u2026\u201dTurning to Alexandria, Hecht says, specifically, \u201c[The] company owns a premier portfolio of Life Science properties, with tenants that work in the Biotech and Technology industries. Many ARE tenants are developing COVID-19 therapeutics and the portfolio is trophy-level quality\u2026\u201dIn line with his comments, Hecht rates ARE shares a Buy. His $185 price target suggests the stock has room for 10% growth in the coming 12 months. (To watch Hecht\u2019s track record, click here)The analyst consensus on Alexandria Real Estate is unanimous; the company has 4 Buy ratings, making the consensus rating a Strong Buy. Shares are selling for $168, and the average price target of $178.75 implies room for a 7% upside. (See Alexandria\u2019s stock analysis on TipRanks)Universal Health Services (UHS)Last up is Universal Health Services, a Pennsylvania-based company providing hospital and healthcare services. UHS operates 400 facilities \u2013 including hospitals, acute care centers, and surgeries \u2013 across the continental US, as well as in Puerto Rico and the UK. The company saw more than $11 billion in revenues last year, and has a market cap of $9.2 billion.While medical facilities have been in high demand during the pandemic, the social lockdown policies put a damper on elective procedures. UHS saw a decline in earnings in Q1 of 37%, to $1.73 per share. UHS has suspended its profit sharing programs \u2013 dividends and stock buybacks \u2013 to conserve capital during the pandemic period. Looking ahead, it\u2019s expected that sharp declines in the Acute Care and Behavioral Health segments will drive a 16% sequential reduction in revenues for the quarter.Covering the stock for Deutsche Bank, analyst Pito Chickering notes several points that favor UHS shares turning around in the near future: \u201cRevenue trends were healthy pre-coronavirus through February, with hospital same-store revenue trends tracking in-line with expectations through mid/late March\u2026 Hospital and provider volumes have recovered more quickly than market expectations with admissions within 10% of pre-COVID-19 levels; occupancy rates across the country are elevated\u2026 We believe there will be pent-up demand for finite OR capacity with prioritization to urgent / emergent procedures, e.g., cardiac procedures vs hips, knees, etc.\u201dChickering\u2019s view is contingent on a further gradual opening of local and state level economies. In the even of an increase in coronavirus cases, however, the analyst does grant, \u201cWe also believe the country and hospitals are better equipped to handle a spike in COVID-19 cases at the local level and national, state and local policy measures will continue to adapt.\u201dChickering rates UHS a Buy, with a $135 price target that implies a 23% one-year upside potential. (To watch Chickering\u2019s track record, click here)United Health Services has 8 Buys and 1 Hold, making the analyst consensus rating a Strong Buy. Share are selling for $109.58 heading into earnings, and the average price target of $135 matches Chickering\u2019s.
