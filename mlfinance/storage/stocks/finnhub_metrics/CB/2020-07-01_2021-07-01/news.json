The insider sold 187 shares of Chubb Inc (NYSE:CB) at an average price of $117.03. After the transaction, the executive's stake in Chubb Inc. moved to 16,686 shares. Shares of Chubb moved lower by 2.5% from the previous closing price.The Importance of Insider Transactions While transactions from an insider shouldn't be used as the sole item to make an investment or trading decision, an insider buying or selling stock in their company can be a good added factor that leads to more conviction in a decision.When an insider buys stock after an important sell off, that can indicate the insider's faith in the success of the organization. Henceforth, if the stock is bought at new highs, it might be because the insider feels that the stock is not overvalued. Conversely, insiders who are selling stock at new lows can potentially indicate some kind of capitulation moment. Insiders selling at new highs can indicate that exec wants to \"take some profit\" and \"lock in a gain.\"Transaction Codes To Focus On Wall Street tends to focus on insider transactions which take place in the open market, viewed inside a Form 4 filing via codes P for purchase and S for sale. If the transaction was an open-market transaction, that means that the insider made a concious decision for the company's stock moving forward.Transaction codes other than P or S are often viewed with less conviction as they are often not tied to a decision by the exec. As an example, transaction code C indicates the conversion of an option. Transaction code A indicates the insider may have been forced to sell shares in order to receive compensation the exec was promised upon being hired by a company.See more from Benzinga  * Earnings Scheduled For July 28, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.
