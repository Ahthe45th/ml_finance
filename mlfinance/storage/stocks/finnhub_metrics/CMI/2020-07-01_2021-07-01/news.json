While growth stocks squirm in a bear market, the overall market continues to stand strong. That said, let\u2019s look at a few top stock trades for next week. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 1: Bitcoin (BTC-USD) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider While altcoins continue to soar, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) has had trouble advancing. Although Bitcoin isn\u2019t under as much pressure as it was in April, it\u2019s far from soaring. Could that change with a breakout?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The cryptocurrency looks like it\u2019s trying to set up for a move higher, although the $58,000 level continues to act as resistance. If Bitcoin can clear this level we could see a move over $60,000 in quick fashion. Over $60,000 puts the $65,000 area in play, then $67,600. On the downside, though, Bitcoin has a lot of notable moving averages close by. However, if it loses the 10-week moving average \u2014 thus losing all the others \u2014 we could see a retest of the $47,000 to $50,000 area. 7 Stocks to Buy Right Now With All Eyes on Crypto Below that, and the 21-week moving average may be in play, followed by $43,000. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 2: Square (SQ) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Square (NYSE:SQ) reported solid earnings, but like I said at the top, growth stocks remain under pressure. As a result, we\u2019re not seeing a robust move to the upside. In fact, Square is having a very difficult time reclaiming some of key moving averages, like the 10-day, 50-day, 10-week and 21-week moving averages. With these acting as resistance, it\u2019s hard to be overly bullish on the stock in the short term, regardless of how good it is or how many investors love it. However, over the key $244 mark and that outlook changes. Above that level, and $250 is possible, along with a test of the 21-day moving average. Above those measures and $275 resistance could be on the table. On the downside, however, if Square takes out this week\u2019s low at $216.70, then $200 and the 200-day moving average is possible. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 3: Cummins (CMI) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Cummins (NYSE:CMI) is not the most exciting stock out there. After hearing it trigger on my alerts though, I couldn\u2019t ignore it. And besides, if a stock is making us money, who cares what it is. This stock is a good lesson too. We didn\u2019t just buy CMI stock over the last few weeks thinking it\u2019s consolidating nicely and set for more gains. We want some form of upside rotation. Notice five straight weeks of Cummins riding the 10-week moving average but not rotating higher. Then last week it closed at the lows and gave us a five-times weekly-down and monthly-down rotation. Ugly! But we weren\u2019t in it, because there wasn\u2019t an upside rotation. Now, buying the retest of the 21-week moving average and $250 breakout level was great. But now we\u2019re seeing a six-times weekly-up and monthly-up rotation. A close over $266.50 puts $275 to $277 in play. 7 Hot Stocks to Consider for a Greener Future Let\u2019s see if CMI stock can gain some momentum here. Top Trades for Monday No. 4: Rocket Companies (RKT) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Last but not least, let\u2019s look at Rocket Companies (NYSE:RKT). This stock has been creamed, down more than 50% from the highs. In just the last two days, shares are down more than 20%. Breaking below $19.37 was an issue, as it opened the door to the $17.50 to $17.78 area. I want to see one of two things here. First, does RKT stock even test this area at all? Second, if it does and it breaks below it, can RKT stock reclaim these levels and/or the current low? If so, a reversal could be brewing and at least give longs a low to measure against. After all, there is a massive gap to fill on the upside. On the downside, a close below $17.50 with no reversal will thrust RKT stock into no man\u2019s land.

It says, \u2018The Chinese Communist Party is aggressively -- plans to reorient and dominate the semiconductor supply chain,\u2019 and it goes into how much money will be they\u2019re pouring into being able to do that.\u201dChief executives including General Motors Co. CEO Mary Barra, Ford Motor Co. CEO James D. Farley, Jr., and Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google participated in the virtual summit.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the meeting showed the administration is serious about addressing supply-chain constraints and softening the blow for affected companies and workers.National Economic Council director Brian Deese and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan hosted the meeting, with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo also participating. Companies invited to join included Dell Technologies Inc., Intel Corp., Medtronic Plc, Northrop Grumman Corp., HP Inc., Cummins Inc., Micron Technology Inc., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., AT&T Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co., as well as GM, Ford and Alphabet Inc.Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said in an interview after the meeting that the White House and Congress are working aggressively to support the semiconductor industry with more domestic manufacturing, research and development as well as efforts to build the workforce. Taiwan\u2019s TSMC also voiced its support. The contract chipmaker, which plays a central role in manufacturing most of the world\u2019s most advanced semiconductors, has secured government incentives to begin building a $12 billion Arizona plant this year.\u201cTSMC is confident that our 5nm advanced fab plan in Phoenix Arizona -- one of the largest foreign direct investments in U.S. history -- will be successful in partnership with the U.S. government,\u201d it said in a statement.The administration intended to highlight elements of the president\u2019s proposed $2.25 trillion infrastructure-focused plan that they believe would improve supply-chain resilience, a White House official said. The agenda also included discussions about the auto industry\u2019s transition to clean energy, job creation and ensuring U.S. economic competitiveness, the official added.Many of the lawmakers supporting additional funding for semiconductors want to see the measure in a standalone competitiveness bill aimed at China, not as part of Biden\u2019s infrastructure package, as it is now. The China bill has some bipartisan support and could have a quicker path through Congress.Intel, Micron, GM, A&T on Roster for White House Chips MeetingBut exactly how to spend and allocate the semiconductor funding is a source of debate among automakers and other consumers of chips, as well as the semiconductor companies themselves.Carmakers are pushing for a portion of the money to be reserved for vehicle-grade chips, warning of a potential 1.3 million shortfall in car and light-duty truck production in the U.S. this year if their industry isn\u2019t given priority.Yet makers of other electronic devices affected by the chip shortage, such as computers and mobile phones, have taken issue with the carmakers\u2019 demands, worried their industries will suffer. The debate was also a factor in the White House meeting.\u201cThere were many, many voices saying, \u2018hey, we can\u2019t just start carving things up for particular industries. We need a solution that works in the medium and long term and that are sensitive to some of the unique challenges of the immediate term,\u2019\u201d Gelsinger said in the interview. \u201cI think we\u2019re working pretty well through that process right now. Nobody will be entirely happy but we\u2019re heading in a good direction.\u201dThe White House has not taken a public position on the issue but has indicated privately to semiconductor industry leaders that it would not support special treatment for one industry, according to people familiar with the matter.Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which lobbies for Ford, General Motors and Stellantis NV (formerly Fiat Chrysler Automobiles), expressed optimism that the Biden administration would at least consider his industry\u2019s arguments.Congress Weighs Countering China on Chips, GOP Wary of Cost (1)He said the White House has not endorsed any specific plans for setting aside money for carmakers, but administration officials \u201cunderstand why the proposal was made.\u201dTo avoid future chip shortages, Blunt\u2019s group proposed that at least 25% of any federal support for the construction of semiconductor factories must go to U.S. facilities that commit to allocating at least 25% of their capacity to automotive-grade chips.John Neuffer, president and chief executive officer of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said the industry understands \u201cthe difficulty the auto sector is feeling right now, and chipmakers are working hard to ramp up production to meet demand in the short term.\u201dFor the long term, he said, the industry needs a boost in domestic production and innovation across the board \u201cso all sectors of our economy have access to the chips they need, and that requires swiftly enacting federal investments in semiconductor manufacturing and research.\u201d(Updates with TSMC\u2019s comments from the seventh paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=2551306f9a9de308ad993771854efbe2025a53f7257dbbb98dfe86605beaf453"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1618245900, "headline": "Cummins Inc. stock outperforms market on strong trading day", "id": 66132551, "image": "https://images.mktw.net/im-220105/social", "related": "CMI", "source": "MarketWatch", "summary": "Shares of Cummins Inc. inched 0.71% higher to $261.23 Monday, on what proved to be an all-around poor trading session for the stock market, with the S&P 500...", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=99c8264c3661e8ce2861a6523fe5dbc567bcc06adf32a0cdff56a5b877eaa790"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1618242303, "headline": "Why Cummins (CMI) is a Top Dividend Stock for Your Portfolio", "id": 66310475, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UYup8AGIrn99rMsHiTllqA--~B/aD04NzY7dz05MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/zacks.com/d0d4ab152198da2f423d92da8a7d22ee", "related": "CMI", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "Dividends are one of the best benefits to being a shareholder, but finding a great dividend stock is no easy task.

Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Cummins has. Cummins's Debt Based on Cummins's balance sheet as of February 10, 2021, long-term debt is at $3.61 billion and current debt is at $554.00 million, amounting to $4.16 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $3.40 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $763.00 million. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Cummins has $22.62 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.18. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and average for another. Why Debt Is Important Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?
