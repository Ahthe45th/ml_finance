According to an Insider Intelligence report, consumers spent $44 billion on gaming software and services last year. However, in 2021, monthly digital gamers are expected to rise year-over-year by only 1.1%.\n\n\n\nUsing the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, let us compare two gaming companies, Take-Two Interactive and Activision Blizzard, and see how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake-Two Interactive Software (TTWO)\n\n\n\nTake-Two Interactive Software, Inc. is a developer, publisher and marketer of interactive entertainment. This interactive entertainment is designed for console gaming systems, personal computers, smartphones and tablets. The company publishes and develops its games through Rockstar Games, 2K, Private Division, Social Point, and Playdots.\n\n\n\nTTWO generates revenue primarily through the sale of video game titles developed internally or video games developed by third parties. A core part of the company\u2019s business strategy is to build entertainment franchises across different genres. TTWO seeks to create sequels for these franchises and explores incremental revenue opportunities through add-on content, virtual currency and in-game purchases.\n\n\n\nLast month, TTWO announced robust fiscal fourth quarter results with GAAP net revenues of $839.4 million, up 10% year-over-year, while digitally delivered GAAP net revenue increased 19% to $753.3 million. \n\n\n\nAt the end of Q4, TTWO had total net bookings of $784.5 million, up 8% year-over-year. The company defines net bookings as the net amount of products and services sold through retail or digitally and includes merchandise, licensing fees and in-game advertising.\n\n\n\nFor fiscal Q1, Take-Two projects net revenues to be between $730 million and $780 million. The company\u2019s forecast for GAAP diluted net income is from $1.00 per share to $1.10 per share. For fiscal 2022, the company expects GAAP net revenue to be between $3.14 billion to $3.24 billion.\n\n\n\nOn June 2, the company acquired privately held Nordeus, a mobile games developer, in a cash and stock deal valued at $378 million. The company had acquired Social Point in 2017 and Playdots in 2020. The acquisitions coordinate well with the company\u2019s strategic initiative of bolstering its mobile business. (See Take-Two Interactive stock analysis on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nTake-Two Interactive\u2019s Chairman and CEO Strauss Zelnick said at the earnings call, \u201cWe anticipate that the overall addressable market for our industry will be notably larger going forward than it was pre-pandemic. However, as the world returns to a new normal, we expect a moderation of the trends that benefited our industry over the past year.\u201d\n\n\n\nZelnick added, \u201c\u2026we're highly optimistic about our growth trajectory, and we'll be making significant investments this year to enhance our enterprise in key areas such as creative talent, IT, and other infrastructure.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe company said on its earnings call that for FY22, it plans to release 21 titles while in FY23 and FY24, TTWO expects to release over 40 titles, including 19 core releases. The company expects to generate 60% of its net bookings from the United States and the remainder from international markets.\n\n\n\nTo that end, the company wants to expand the distribution of its products in Asia and establish its presence in online gaming, especially in countries like China and South Korea. The company\u2019s label, 2K Sports, has obtained a multiple year license from the NBA to develop on online version of its NBA simulation game in China, Taiwan, South Korea and Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\nFollowing the announcement of the Nordeus acquisition, Robert W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian reiterated a Buy and a price target of $215 on the stock. Sebastian viewed the acquisition as \u201c\u2026providing Take-Two with greater scale in mobile franchises and development resources/expertise. We expect further industry consolidation in coming months and years given the fast pace of new game development and the increasing importance of mobile as a platform.\u201d\n\n\n\nConsensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 11 Buys, 6 Holds and 1 Sell. The TTWO average analyst price target of $213.91 implies approximately 16% upside potential to current levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivision Blizzard (ATVI)\n\n\n\nActivision Blizzard has three business segments, including Activision Publishing, Blizzard Entertainment and King Digital Entertainment.\n\n\n\nActivision primarily generates revenues through games, in-game sales and licensing software to third parties. It offers content through both premium and free-to-play offerings. The company\u2019s key product franchises include Call of Duty, Warcraft and Candy Crush.\n\n\n\nThese franchises delivered strong double-digit year-over-year rise in net bookings in Q1. In the first quarter, ATVI posted net revenues of $2.28 billion, a jump of 27.4% year-over-year. The company reported diluted earnings of $0.79 per share compared to diluted earnings of $0.65 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\n\n\nFor Q2, ATVI expects revenues of $2.14 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $0.91 per share. For the full year of 2021, the company anticipates net revenues of $8.37 billion with earnings of $3.42 per share.\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s strategy centers around its view that franchises completely owned by ATVI offer endless opportunities. Accordingly, the company is increasing its investment in its franchises and potential new franchises as it also faces competition from Chinese companies and platform providers.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Activision plans to expand its creative and development teams. From the start of last year through to the end of 2022, it plans to hire more than 2,000 developers.\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s Call of Duty has been a successful franchise, as the number of players has grown to over 100 million players in the span of less than a year. The Call of Duty: Mobile continued to see strong year-over-year player engagement and investment in Q1. The franchise is also attracting millions of players in China. Later this year, the company intends to release its premium Call of Duty game with multiplayer and cooperative modes of play.\n\n\n\nFurther developing its franchises, the company\u2019s King Digital Entertainment  has introduced new Candy Crush features and portfolio titles. King\u2019s Crash Bandicoot: On the Run, a new mobile title launched in Q1 this year, has been downloaded 30 million times to date. (See Activision Blizzard stock analysis on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nActivision intends to further expand its franchise pipeline in 2022 and beyond. This includes Diablo IV, Overwatch 2 and multiple Warcraft mobile titles that are expected to grow substantially. \n\n\n\nActivision Blizzard\u2019s Chief Commercial Officer Armin Zerza said at its earnings call, \u201cRegarding the fleet, our expanded teams are focused on delivering epic in-game and upfront content. This means that we'll continue to support our franchises with new in-game content, events and features all of which are critical elements of our business as we focus on keeping our communities engaged and drive year-round player investment.\u201d\n\n\n\nLast month, following ATVI\u2019s recent changes to the content for Overwatch 2 and addition of new content, Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang reiterated a Buy and a price target of $110 on the stock. Yang said in a research note to investors, \u201cWe believe Activision Blizzard has entered a transition period to reposition its studio assets and development talents in response to aging franchises and new player engagement and monetization trends. So far, it has executed a series of successful turnaround for its core franchise, Call of Duty.\u201d\n\n\n\nConsensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 16 Buys. The ATVI average analyst price target of $117.13 implies approximately 21% upside potential to current levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBottomline \n\n\n\nAnalysts are cautiously optimistic about TTWO while they are bullish on ATVI. While TTWO is building a variety of franchises across different genres, ATVI is working on innovating its franchises that are wholly owned by the company. \n\n\n\nBased on the upside potential over the next 12 months, ATVI seems to be a better buy.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

With a historic economic reopening underway, one of the better-known lockdown stocks has now ground to a halt. The stock failed to break the $100 mark back in February and is currently treading water in the $90 range, even after posting yet another strong quarter. (See Activision Blizzard stock analysis on TipRanks) Return to Normalcy Won't Diminish Demand Many people will head back to the physical realm as they return to normalcy after months of staying indoors, where they were entertained by video games, streaming content and the like. That said, it\u2019s likely a mistake to throw in the towel on Activision Blizzard as lockdown stocks sour. ATVI stock is not necessarily at risk of surrendering its 2020 gains, as many growth stocks seem to be doing these days. That's because Activision Blizzard has a fresh slate of new titles that are likely to keep its players engaged well into the post-pandemic era. Many new gamers that the company won over during lockdowns will probably stick around well after this pandemic is over. Additionally, with its pipeline of widely anticipated next-generation titles\u2014 including Diablo 2 Resurrected, Diablo 4, Overwatch 2, and the new Call of Duty game\u2014expected to gradually trickle in over the next few years, investors should not discount the possibility of another blockbuster hit for Activision Blizzard. Given the popularity of its games, Activision Blizzard\u2019s userbase may prove to be far stickier than investors are expecting, especially as the company moves into the next console era. Consoles as Catalysts Gamers are eagerly awaiting the switch to next-generation consoles. Thanks to the semiconductor shortage and unprecedented demand for these consoles, the Playstation 5 (PS5) and Xbox Series X upgrade cycles appear to have been delayed. Furthermore, both new consoles remain light on big-budget next-generation titles. This is an issue that is expected to resolve in time, though. Moreover, Activision Blizzard is a proactive company that will likely step up to the plate and serve investors and gamers with something to get excited about. Certainly, pandemic tailwinds are poised to fade for Activision Blizzard and the broader videogame scene. But with numerous catalysts to look forward to, including the wider adoption of new-generation consoles, Activision Blizzard should be viewed as one of the more resilient lockdown beneficiaries. The company seems to be in a unique and enviable position to further build upon the tremendous momentum garnered during COVID-19 lockdowns, as a different slate of tailwinds come into effect post-pandemic. Wall Street's Take According to TipRanks\u2019 consensus analyst rating, ATVI stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 16 analyst ratings, there are 16 unanimous Buy recommendations. As for price targets, the average analyst price target is $117.13, with an upside of 22.8%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $102 per share to a high of $125 per share. The Bottom Line For the first quarter, Activision Blizzard reported 27% revenue growth and 40% non-GAAP EPS growth, both of which handsomely beat the company\u2019s own guidance. These impressive numbers were fueled by the pandemic-induced stay-at-home boom. That said, it is worth noting that management has raised its full-year guidance, despite the less favorable year-over-year comparisons ahead. Management cautioned investors that coming second-quarter year-over-year comparisons are going to look weak. At this juncture, mild coming quarters are to be expected. If any quarterly disappointments send shares lower, long-term investors might have an opportunity to capitalize on weakness, as the most meaningful revenue growth from the name will most likely occur in 2022 and beyond.

A couple of chief executive officers and an executive board chair were among the insiders buying shares this past week. A master limited partnership, a real estate investment trust and a conglomerate were among companies that say notable insider buying. Conventional wisdom says that insiders and 10% owners really only buy shares of a company for one reason -- they believe the stock price will rise and they want to profit from it. So insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors, particularly when there is uncertainty in the markets or the markets are near all-time highs. Note that, though earnings reporting season is waning, some insiders are still prohibited from buying or selling shares. Here are some of the most noteworthy insider purchases that were reported in the past week. Chief Executive Officer Robert Duggan of Summit Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: SMMT) bought more than 11.36 million shares, and another executive picked up almost 389,100 shares via trust, all at an offering price of $5.24 apiece. These purchases totaled over $61.59 million altogether and lifted Duggan's stake to more than 67.66 million shares. The purchase of about 667,980 more PennyMac Financial Services Inc (NYSE: PFSI) shares last week by a director (and frequent buyer) for $56.84 to $58.86 per share totaled $38.66 million. It also raised that director's stake to more than 2.17 million shares. Note that the stock ended the week trading at $60.25 a share. Wireless communication company Radius Global Infrastructure Inc (NASDAQ: RADI) saw a pair of beneficial owners indirectly buy 925,000 shares each in the wake of better than expected first-quarter sales numbers. At $13.95 per share, these insider purchases added up to more than $25.8 million altogether. The Avis Budget Group Inc. (NASDAQ: CAR) executive board chair, Bernardo Hees, indirectly scooped up 63,000 shares midweek. At prices ranging from $74.94 to $79.94 a share, the purchases totaled around $5 million. The timing looks fortunate, as the stock ended last week trading at $86.83 a share. Biglari Holdings Inc (NYSE: BH) CEO Sardar Biglari indirectly added more shares to his stake in this San Antonio-based conglomerate in the past week. The more than 19,300 Class B shares had prices of $147.80 to $159.00 apiece, costing him around $2.90 million. Those shares ended the week trading at $156.03. Specialty chemical products provider Univar Solutions Inc (NYSE: UNVR) saw two of its directors pay $25.46 to $26.00 apiece in the middle of the week for a combined 105,000 of its shares. That added up to more than $2.7 million. Note that another director sold almost 25,000 shares of this as well. An American Homes 4 Rent (NYSE: AMH) beneficial owner indirectly bought 20,000 shares at between $36.84 and $37 apiece. That cost that owner more than $1.99 million and raised the stake to about 17.01 million shares. The real estate investment trust was last seen trading at $37.31 per share. As it reportedly mulls chemicals business acquisitions, Energy Transfer LP (NYSE: ET) had a director pick up 200,000 shares indirectly at prices that ranged from $9.48 to $9.56. These purchases added up to more than $1.90 million. The timing seems fortunate here too, as the master limited partnership ended the week at $10.11 per share. A director added 17,000 more shares of Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATVI) to his stake last week, about a week after it released a strong quarterly report. The shares were acquired via trust at prices ranging from $93.36 to $95.74 a share, which totaled more than $1.62 million. This same director bought 5,000 shares in the previous week as well.

The company delivered strong growth across its largest franchises, shrugging off the challenges presented by the pandemic. The video game company reported net revenues of $2.28 billion, an increase of 27.37% year-over-year compared to $1.79 billion in Q1 2020. Net revenues from digital channels totaled $2.01 billion, with a non-GAAP operating margin coming in at 43%. Diluted EPS increased to $0.79 from the $0.65 share price reported in 1Q 2020. Activision Blizzard operating cash flow soared to $844 million, from $148 million in the same period last year. Net bookings were $2.07 billion, as in-game net bookings totaled $1.34 billion. Q1 results exceeded expectations on Activision Blizzard's outlook, benefiting from strong growth across its franchises. Investments in franchises are allowing the video game company to connect and engage with more people than in the past. Furthermore, the company\u2019s creative and commercial teams are performing well, driving growth across key segments. For instance, revenues in the Activision segment, including Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone, were up 72% year-over-year. (See Activision Blizzard stock analysis on TipRanks). Activision Blizzard remains well positioned for stellar financial results for the remainder of the year and into 2022. Management expects to see revenue of $2.14 billion and EPS of $0.91 in Q2. For the full year, net revenues should total $8.37 billion with earnings per share of $3.42. Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian has reiterated a Buy rating on Activision Blizzard, beating expectations in 1Q on strong monetization trends. \u201cMore surprising was management's commentary that usage and monetization trends remained steady through April even as regional lockdowns ease. Overall, we continue to like the stock and believe that further upside is likely from positive usage trends, strong online/mobile pipeline (investing in more developer talent), and continuing positive secular growth trends,\u201d Sebastian wrote. The analyst has a $118 price target on the stock, implying 33.05% upside potential to current levels. The consensus among analysts on Wall Street is that Activision Blizzard is a Strong Buy based on 14 Buy and 2 Hold ratings. The average analyst price target of $115.88 implies 30.66% upside potential to current levels. ATVI scores an 8 out of 10 on TipRanks\u2019 Smart Score rating system, suggesting it is likely to outperform the overall market.

The gaming giant did to the estimates what a character in one of its action-packed games might do to an enemy: turned them into mincemeat. Although the strong performance came as less of a shock to Baird\u2019s Colin Sebastian, the analyst notes a more telling remark made by the company following the results. \u201cMore surprising was management's commentary that usage and monetization trends remained steady through April even as regional lockdowns ease,\u201d the 5-star analyst said. \u201cOverall, we continue to like the stock and believe that further upside is likely from positive usage trends, strong online/mobile pipeline (investing in more developer talent), and continuing positive secular growth trends.\u201d So, what happened in Q1? Revenue increased by 36% year-over-year to $2.07 billion, coming in $290 million ahead of the estimates. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.84 beat the Street\u2019s forecast by $0.15. The big revenue beat came off the back of \u201ccontinued Call of Duty momentum.\u201d The franchise\u2019 MAUs were up by 40% from the same period last year and console/PC in-game bookings showed a 60% year-over-year uptick. King revenue growth also accelerated, up by 22% year-over-year compared to 15% growth in Q4. The King segment came under the ATVI fold five years ago and is led by Candy Crush. Going forward, in what Sebastian calls a \u201cstrong sign of confidence,\u201d the company said that over the next two years to \u201csupport core franchise growth,\u201d it plans on hiring over 2,000 new developers. Following the results, Sebastian made some key estimate revisions and boosted the 2021 revenue forecast from a prior year-over-year uptick of 0.4% to 2.9%, while operating margin is expected to hit 43.1% vs. the previous estimate of 42.5%. Moreover, despite higher marketing and R&D investments, Sebastian expects 2021 non-GAAP EPS will reach $3.71, compared to $3.62 beforehand. All in all, Sebastian reiterated an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on ATVI stock backed by a $118 price target. The implication for investors? Upside of 28%. (To watch Sebastian\u2019s track record, click here) Sebastian is no lone ATVI bull. Based on 13 Buys vs. 2 Holds, the analyst consensus rates this stock a Strong Buy. The forecast is for 12-month gains of 26%, given the average price target comes in at $115.88.
