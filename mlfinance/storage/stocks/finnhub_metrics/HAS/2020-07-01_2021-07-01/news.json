Upon the closing of this transaction, eOne Music will function as a separate entity, led by its current Global President, Chris Taylor. The unit will focus on developing a creator-first brand that will have global reach and expertise. Hasbro (HAS) Chairman and CEO Brian Goldner said, \u201cThis transaction will ensure that eOne Music is well positioned to unlock great opportunities for its many talented artists and partners, as Hasbro continues to focus on the core strategic elements of our Brand Blueprint to further strengthen our position as a purpose-led play and entertainment company.\u201d (See Hasbro stock analysis on TipRanks) Hasbro purchased eOne Music in 2019. It plans to use the proceeds from this transaction to pare down debt and for other corporate purposes.

Beckel believes Hasbro has emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic \u201cstronger\u201d and can grow revenue at a \u201chealthy pace\u201d despite difficult industry comps in 2021. Overall, consensus among analysts is that Hasbro is a Moderate Buy, based on 5 Buys and 2 Holds. The average analyst price target of $106.33 implies upside potential of 9.6%.
