Naturally, the bullishness extended to high-profitability potential growth investments like Senseonics (NYSEAMERICAN:SENS). As a play on the science, Senseonics is brilliant. As a portfolio booster, SENS stock might be a disaster. Source: Shutterstock About the only thing that could change the last sentence is if you were short the medical technology firm. To be clear, I\u2019m not recommending you short Senseonics shares, since that brings up another level of variability and risk. However, I am asking you to consider \u2014 as an idea, not advice \u2014 to sell SENS stock. Perhaps not all of it, but take some profits off the table while you still can. Before I get deluged with hate mail, let\u2019s go over why the idea of dumping SENS stock arouses intense anger. Fundamentally, I can understand the argument that Sensenoics is a game changer for diabetes patients. In the old paradigm, patients had to endure frequent and often painful finger pricks to monitor their blood-sugar levels. On the other hand, Senseonics provides freedom through its long-term continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips You can read the literature yourself, but to provide a very quick summary, medical professionals insert a sensor underneath the patient\u2019s skin. This enables frequent, accurate monitoring of blood-sugar levels for 90 days (via the Eversense 90-Day CGM System), doing away with finger pricks entirely. Further, as our own Mark Hake predicted recently, \u201cMy thesis is that SENS stock will recover once the FDA allows Senseonics to start selling its device in the U.S.\u201d Further, Hake mentions that Senseonics can follow in the footsteps of another CGM company, DexCom (NASDAQ:DXCM). 10 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks for Your Reliability Short List It\u2019s possible. Is it probable? The market doesn\u2019t agree. SENS Stock Is a High-Risk, Low-Probability Trade You might recall that a week or so ago, one of the biggest headlines was that debris from a Chinese rocket might land somewhere on populated parts of earth. Worse yet, experts didn\u2019t know exactly where the debris would land until hours before impact. Amid the cacophony, I appreciated one scientist\u2019s voice of reason. The world is about 70% water, so the chances of the debris landing on people are minimal. In other words, you have bigger problems to worry about. And that expert was right. Sure, the debris killing people made for great headlines. After all, if it bleeds, it leads. But sometimes, you must push away sensationalism and simply run the numbers. That\u2019s really the thesis for SENS stock that matters. For instance, medical equipment giant Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has a CGM called FreeStyle Libre. I\u2019m not sure if this CGM is better than Senseonics\u2019 CGM. But you know what? It doesn\u2019t matter. The market wants ABT, not SENS stock. Look at the variance in the shares available on Abbott\u2019s bid-ask spread. At time of writing, 10% more shares are available at the bid of $118.53 than the ask of $118.51. Put simply, more buyers exist than sellers, which suggests (though not guarantees) that ABT will move higher. My InvestorPlace colleague mentioned DexCom. Here, the situation is way starker, with nearly 38% more shares available at a $334.41 bid than an ask of $334.78. It implies again that DXCM will move higher. Unfortunately, Senseonics is a completely different story. In this case, nearly 36% more shares are available at a $1.91 ask than at a $1.90 bid. Stated another way, it\u2019s the opposite of the current housing market: Way more people want to sell than want to buy. The Math, Not the Feels Naturally, the guttural reaction to the above is that people who are selling SENS stock are idiots. Further, I\u2019m an idiot. Nevertheless, my idiocy has no bearing on free market dynamics. In fact, I could write the most beautifully crafted bullish (or bearish) argument for SENS stock. Folks, it\u2019s not going to change the wide discrepancy in the shares offered on the bid-ask spread. Definitely, it won\u2019t change a discrepancy like this. But this is a lesson on proper investing strategies, if you want to hear it. Idiots or not, the market is dumping SENS stock \u2014 and they want to dump some more! If you feel that\u2019s a bullish case for Senseonics, you\u2019re taking a huge risk. For me, I\u2019m staying away with 10-foot pole.
