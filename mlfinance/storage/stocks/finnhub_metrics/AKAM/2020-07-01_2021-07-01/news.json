The Akamai Technologies Thesis: Management surprised to the upside by guided to 30%+ growth for Edge Applications, Nispel said in the upgrade note. \u201cAKAM's LT model calls for a 3-5 year revenue growth CAGR of 6-10% comprised of 2-5% Edge Technologies, and 20%+ Security Technologies,\" he wrote. \"Over the next 3-5 years, consensus expects 7% CAGR comprised of <1% Edge Technologies growth and <18% Security Technology growth where it appears consensus discounts AKAM's' ability to execute within both segments.\u201d Although the company faces significant competition in both Edge and Security technologies, both businesses have a large total addressable market of more than $47 billion, \u201cin which we see ample opportunity for all,\u201d the analyst further mentioned.

The stock price moved up to $97.9 following the option alert. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-02-26 Strike Price: $97.50 Volume: 0 Open Interest: 85 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it. Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being \"out of the money\". This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are \"bullish\" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are \"bearish\" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

Moreover, the company cautioned that India\u2019s ban on 59 China-based web applications will continue to hurt its financial results throughout the remainder of 2020.The company's 3Q adjusted EPS jumped 19% to $1.31 year-over-year and beat Street estimates of $1.23. The company\u2019s CEO Dr. Tom Leighton said, \u201cOur excellent third quarter results were driven by the continued strong performance of our security products and sustained high traffic levels on the Akamai Edge platform.\u201d (See AKAM stock analysis on TipRanks).Akamai raised its 2020 revenue guidance to $3.164 billion and $3.189 billion, up from the earlier guidance range of $3.125-$3.175 billion. Adjusted EPS is now forecasted to land in the range of $5.16-$5.20, higher than the previous projection of $5.02-$5.12. For 4Q, the company expects revenues and adjusted EPS in the range of $812-$837 million and $1.28-$1.32, respectively.Following the earnings report, Oppenheimer analyst\u00a0Timothy Horan\u00a0reiterated a Buy rating with a price target of $130 (21.8% upside potential). In a note to investors, Timothy wrote that Akamai \u201cbenefits from the shift of entertainment and commerce to the Internet. It is well positioned to provide security, better wireless latency, and to enable broadcast video over the public Internet.\u201dCurrently, the Street has a bullish outlook on the stock. The Strong Buy analyst consensus is based on 9 Buys and 3 Holds. With shares up 23.5% year-to-date, the average\u00a0price target\u00a0of $122.67 implies additional upside potential of about 15% to current levels.Related News:   Shopify Inks Social Commerce Partnership With TikTok   NCR\u2019s 3Q Sales Dive 11% As Covid-19 Hurts Hardware Business   Microsoft Down After-Hours Despite Very Strong Earnings Beat More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Liberty Oilfield\u2019s 3Q Sales Top Estimates As Completions Recover   * Daimler Teams Up With Google\u2019s Waymo For Self-Driving Trucks   * Caterpillar Falls As Dismal Q3 Earnings Reflect Weak Demand   * Rexnord's Quarterly Profit Beats The Street; Analyst Sees 22% Upside", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4cdf98bf3974ad1a4ac94d1e1926963c0a9143b8e7aa0eb1243dd699d183f2ff"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1603883520, "headline": "GE, Juniper, Stryker, Akamai: What to Watch When the Stock Market Opens Today", "id": 55205012, "image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-250944/social", "related": "AKAM", "source": "wsj", "summary": "The S&P 500 index is poised to accelerate its drop this week after rising coronavirus infections shook investors' confidence.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4b1879a118730f6bed7b79fb8aae3dad4c3b01e63be29b2ac893a03f7f279453"}, {"category": "company news", "datetime": 1603835220, "headline": "Akamai Stock Slides in Late Trading Despite Earnings Beat", "id": 55231288, "image": "", "related": "AKAM", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "The content-delivery network and security software company posted revenue for the third quarter of $793 million, up 12% from a year ago, and ahead of the Street consensus at $775 million.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=075c6215b144ad18ec023096755ca0d2368513ac344a2d942ed70c101ee8c566"}, {"category": "company news", "datetime": 1603833909, "headline": "Akamai Technologies (AKAM) Q3 Earnings and Revenues Top Estimates", "id": 55231289, "image": "", "related": "AKAM", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "Akamai Technologies (AKAM) delivered earnings and revenue surprises of 6.50% and 2.19%, respectively, for the quarter ended September 2020.
