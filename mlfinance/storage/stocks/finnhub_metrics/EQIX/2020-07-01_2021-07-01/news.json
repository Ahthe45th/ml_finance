Everything is both up and down. The major stock indexes are showing strong gains for the past year, but have seen recent pullbacks. High volatility, however, brings on opportunities. During these pullbacks, investors get a chance to \u2018buy low and sell high,\u2019 taking advantage of short-term falls in share prices. There\u2019s risk, of course. Stocks don\u2019t exist in a vacuum, and the forces tugging on them are subject to their own varying influences. Inflation worries, sparked by Federal spending plans, have pushed up bond yields, but the Federal Reserve has no intention of raising interest rates any time soon. The financial landscape is uncertain \u2013 and the only clarity is that, for now, stocks are currently offering the best rates of return. Wall Street\u2019s analysts are still seeing plenty \u2013 in their words \u2013 attractive entry points, stocks that are primed for just this sort of trading. We\u2019ve used the TipRanks database to pull up the details on three such stocks. Let's take a closer look. AbCellera Biologics (ABCL) We'll start with AbCellera, which holds a fascinating position in the biotech industry. The company is a leader in human antibody research, researching the immune system to develop antibodies which be used as the base for new drugs and disease treatments. AbCellera \u2013 and its tech platform \u2013 have been involved in the fight against COVID-19 since last summer, researching potential antibody treatments for the virus. Its Covid-19 drug, Bamlanivimab, developed in partnership with Eli Lilly, was granted an emergency use authorization by the FDA this past November, and has shown positive results in two Phase 3 clinical trials. AbCellera is no stranger to pandemic-related research. The company had a leading role in the Pandemic Prevention Platform, part of the DARPA Biological Tech Office. AbCellera works on developing countermeasures to pandemic agents on an accelerated timescale. ABCL shares are new to the public market; the company held its IPO this past December. In its first day of trading, ABCL jumped from a $20 initial price to an afternoon high above $70 before closing the day at $58.90. The IPO raised over $555.5 million in gross proceeds. Since then, the stock has fallen, and ABCL shares are now down 55%. This opens up the \u2018attractive entry point\u2019 seen by Credit Suisse analyst Tiago Fauth. \u201cWith the pace of new company creation in biotech at highs, and a clear value proposition for partners (high-throughput solution intended to shorten the antibody discovery cycle and generate higher probability drug candidates), we believe the pullback in shares offers an attractive entry point for investors looking to capitalize on the disruptive potential of a leading technology-powered drug discovery platform,\u201d Fauth opined. Getting into the details, the Credit Suisse analyst adds, \u201cWe believe ABCL offers uniquely strong thesis fundamentals that clearly stand out from some of the comps that have lagged in recent days, including (1) visibility on substantial near-term cash flows generation from bamlanivimab and no financing overhang, (2) a differentiated and increasingly validated discovery platform with a large TAM, and (3) underappreciated LT business model optionality.\u201d To this end, Fauth gives ABCL shares a $54 target price, suggesting a robust 103% upside potential by year\u2019s end. His bullish target supports his Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating. (To watch Fauth\u2019s track record, click here) Sometimes, Wall Street\u2019s analysts all agree, and that\u2019s the case here. ABCL has 5 recent reviews and all are to Buy, giving the stock a Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares are trading for $26.55 with an average target of $55.80 implying ~107% one-year upside. (See ABCL stock analysis on TipRanks) Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) The next 'attractive' stock we're looking at is Ionis Pharmaceuticals, a California-based clinical research firm focusing on RNA-targeted therapeutics. These medications are designed to interact with the patient\u2019s own RNA, making for a precise treatment that disrupts disease processes. Ionis has three drugs approved and an active pipeline of candidates in development. The approved drugs are Spinraza, used to treat spinal muscular dystrophy; Tegsedi, used to treat the neurodegenerative disease ATTR; and Waylivra, which treat genetically caused triglycerides in the blood. Of the three drugs, Spinraza has the highest sales, and brought in $2 billion in worldwide revenue last year. More than 11,000 patients were receiving Spinraza at the end of 4Q20. The other two approved drugs, Tegsedi and Waylivra, saw product sales increase 65% from 2019 to 2020. Strong product sales allowed Ionis to finish 2020 with $1.9 billion in cash on hand. The stock has slipped 30% since its recent peak in January, but Oppenheimer's 5-star analyst Kevin Degeeter views the \"current valuation as offering an attractive entry point for investors with 9-plus month outlook\u2026\u201d Expanding on this outlook, the analyst adds, \u201cWe view simplification of IONS's portfolio and transition from partnering to investment in wholly owned pipeline programs as offering a catalyst for unlocking value from the RNAi platform. We expect IONS shares to enjoy steady multiple expansion as the company diversifies revenue away from Spinraza royalties toward in-house orphan drug therapies, including TTR. There could be upside to our outlook if IONS identifies creative structures to unlock value from its broad pipeline of partnered programs with Biogen, Pfizer, Roche, and Novartis.\u201d Based on the above, DeGeeter rates IONS shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and sets a $63 price target that implies room for a 49% one-year upside. (To watch DeGeeter\u2019s track record, click here) What does the rest of the Street think? Looking at the consensus breakdown, opinions from other analysts are more spread out. 6 Buys, 3 Holds and 2 Sells add up to a Moderate Buy consensus. In addition, the $56.70 average price target indicates 33% upside potential. (See IONS stock analysis on TipRanks) Equinix (EQIX) From biopharma and biotech, we\u2019ll change gears and take a look at digital tech. Equinix is a leader in the colocation data center market, operating over 200 data centers in 25 countries across the America, Europe and the Middle East, and Asia. The company does business as a real estate investment trust, owning and managing the data centers, which are leased out to business clients. As can be imagined, a major owner/operator of data centers would find itself well-positioned to reap benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 and Equinix did. It might be fairer to say, however, that the company\u2019s model proved immune to the virus. Equinix\u2019s business has been growing for 18 years, and the corona crisis couldn\u2019t dent that. In 4Q20, the company recorded its 72nd consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth. The top line for 2020 came in at $5.99 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Acquisition costs and losses due to debt extinguishment pushed income down by 27% yoy. Looking ahead, the company projects income in range of $6.58 billion to $6.64 billion, for another annual gain of 10% to 11%. Equinix is continuing to expand, and earlier this month released plans for $3 billion hyperscale program, financed in part by joint venture partners. The project will increase the company\u2019s ability to meet the demands of its 10,000-strong customer base. Sami Badri, in his coverage of this stock for Credit Suisse, writes of Equinix\u2019s general situation. \u201c[As] we head towards a post-COVID world, digital leaders will be reminded of the importance of minimizing time to market and the ability to rapidly alter workload capabilities, both of which are eased through the use of the Equinix Metal Platform... Through its partner solutions EQIX will seek to complement its existing interconnection, networking and compute services to offer an expanded choice of Infrastructure as a Service solutions, which will only grow EQIX's appeal among data center customers looking for a long-term solution to best serve their end consumers,\u201d Badri wrote. Regarding the stock\u2019s value to investors, Badri adds, \u201cEQIX is trading below large cap peer DLR based on consensus estimates, also a new recent development. We believe the recent pull back in EQIX's trading price makes this a very attractive entry point.\u201d In all, the analyst gives this stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and his $942 price target implies a 43% upside over the next 12 months. (To watch Badri\u2019s track record, click here) Who doesn\u2019t like a market leader with a near two-decade record of revenue growth? Wall Street\u2019s analysts are unanimous here, giving EQIX 13 Buy reviews for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares are selling for $660.23, and their $838.92 average price target implies a 27% one-year upside potential from that level.

Yet with stocks at all-time highs, many growth stocks now have stretched valuations. Those steep earnings and sales multiples aren\u2019t necessarily a problem as long as the companies keep delivering the growth for which investors are looking. If the growth slows down, growth stocks can take a big hit. For example, former growth stock Under Armour Inc (NYSE: UAA) saw its growth numbers start to slump back in 2016, and its stock ultimately dropped from above $54 to as low as $11.40 by late 2017. Secular growth stocks are a rare breed of companies that analysts say will continue growing forever. Here are four secular growth stocks that BofA Securities analysts love. Amazon.cm, Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) Not only is Amazon a secular growth stock, it is a market leader in two of the largest secular growth markets in the world today. Amazon is the market leader in e-commerce, a secular growth theme that will likely continue to play out for decades. It is also the market leader in cloud services, another business that will continue to grow as long as the world keeps producing more data. Amazon is still in the early stages of the retail transition from offline to online, and Amazon\u2019s AWS cloud revenue growth could even accelerate this year as IT spending recovers post-pandemic, said BofA analyst Justin Post. BofA Securities has a Buy rating and $4,150 price target for AMZN stock. Alphabet, Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Like Amazon, Alphabet has a basket of secular growth businesses. Its online advertising business and YouTube video platform are unrivaled, and global internet and smartphone usage will likely continue to rise indefinitely. In addition, Google Cloud gives Alphabet exposure to the cloud business, while Waymo gives Alphabet exposure to next-generation auto technology. Post said investors shouldn\u2019t worry too much about Google\u2019s recent decision to remove support for third-party cookies from the Chrome browser over the next year. The decision could make Google\u2019s \u201cprivacy sandbox\u201d even more valuable for app developers, the analyst said. BofA has a Buy rating and $2,440 price target for Alphabet stock. Chewy Inc (NYSE: CHWY) In the company\u2019s fiscal third quarter, Chewy reported 44.9% revenue growth and 58.4% net income growth. It\u2019s unlikely the company will maintain that growth rate forever, but the online pet supply business is certainly on a secular growth track. Analyst Nat Schindler said credit card data so far in 2021 suggests Chewy\u2019s 2020 momentum is spilling over into at least the first half of this year. In addition to growing earnings and revenue, the analyst said Chewy is well-positioned to grow its market share, its margins and its pet pharmaceutical sales. BofA Securities has a Buy rating on Chewy with a $133 price target. Equinix Inc (NASDAQ: EQIX) Equinix is the largest data center operator in the world. Big data is a major secular growth theme, and Equinix grew its revenue by 8.7% in 2020. Equinix should benefit from growing demand for network-neutral colocation, said BofA analyst Michael Funk. Colocation demand should continue to grow alongside enterprise data usage over time. In addition to the stock\u2019s growth opportunity, Funk said there is an extremely high technical barrier to entry in the data center market, limiting potential future competition for Equinix. BofA Securities has a Buy rating on Equinix with an $865 price target.

As part of its low latency PoP-to-PoP network strategy, EllaLink will open three interconnection and managed colocation PoPs in Equinix data centers in Madrid, Lisbon and S\u00e3o Paulo. The PoPs will be connected to the EllaLink landing site in Sines, and onwards, over two diverse terrestrial routes.

EllaLink is a state-of-the-art optical platform offering secure high capacity connectivity on a unique and diverse transatlantic route, linking the major terrestrial and subsea hubs in Europe and Latin America. This new link between the European and Brazilian data centers of Equinix will increase connectivity between the two continents at a time of significant market growth in Latin America.

EllaLink will be ready for service in spring 2021, creating the first-ever high capacity direct fiber path between the two continents.\u201cOffering one hop connections between Latin America and Europe with a round trip delay of 60ms is a game changer from a transatlantic latency perspective.
