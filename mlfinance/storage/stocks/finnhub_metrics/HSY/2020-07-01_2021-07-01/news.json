Dickerson said, \u201cThe brand will add further diversification to Hershey\u2019s portfolio and help satisfy those consumers increasingly looking for reduced sugar intake.\u201d The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That\u2019s based on 6 Buys versus 5 Holds. The average analyst price target of $173.91 implies that shares are fully valued at current levels. Shares have increased 15.7% over the past six months.

The move helps Hershey take another step towards balancing its portfolio of chocolate and candy favorites with healthier options like better-for-you snacks and confections. The deal will ultimately strengthen Hershey's U.S. BFY confection portfolio.Furthermore, the Lily's buyout deal is expected to be slightly accretive to the company\u2019s earnings in the first full year post the closing of the deal.Chuck Raup, Hershey\u2019s President U.S. said, \"Hershey is focused on developing a BFY confection portfolio that offers a variety of choices to meet the evolving needs of our consumers. Lily's is a great strategic complement to our existing offerings in this growing segment of the confection category.\u201d (See Hershey stock analysis on TipRanks)Following the acquisition, Jefferies analyst Robert Dickerson reiterated the stock\u2019s price target of $170 (1.6% downside potential) and a Hold rating.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dickerson said, \u201cThe brand will add further diversification to Hershey\u2019s portfolio and help satisfy those consumers increasingly looking for reduced sugar intake.\u201dThe rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That\u2019s based on 6 Buys versus 5 Holds. The average analyst price target of $173.91 implies that shares are fully valued at current levels.
