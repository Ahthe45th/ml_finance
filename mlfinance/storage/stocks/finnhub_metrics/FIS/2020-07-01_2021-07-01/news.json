Cash accounted for 27.4pc of money taken at shop tills in 2019 but the pandemic halved this figure to 13.4pc last year, a report from Worldpay, the payments processor formerly owned by RBS, found. It predicted that notes and coins' share of transactions in shops would fall to 6.9pc in 2024. Last year 49pc of spending in shops was made by debit card and 21pc by credit card, Worldpay said. Other countries are turning their back on cash even more quickly, however. Norway's shoppers used cash for just 4.5pc of their in-store purchases last year, down from 13.8pc in 2019, and the report predicted a figure of just 0.9pc in 2024. Sweden was forecast to have cash usage of 0.4pc in three years' time, although its use of cash last year, 8.8pc, was higher than Norway's. France has already overtaken the UK on the road to a cashless society: its use of notes and coins was 11.8pc last year, 1.6 percentage points less than Britain's, and was forecast to be just 5.7pc in three years' time. Worldpay said cash transaction values had fallen steeply around the world in 2020: by 21.9pc in North America, by 33.6pc in Europe, by 34.7pc in Latin America and by 36.6pc in the Asia-Pacific region. It forecast that cash use would decline by an additional 38pc from 2020 to just 12.7pc of global point-of-sale volumes by 2024. \"The sun is setting faster on cash,\" the company said. \"Cards, mobile wallets and other digital alternatives were already catching up or exceeding cash at the point of sale. With the pandemic, safety concerns around cash combined with physical distancing suddenly rendered it impractical. \"Though not inherently high risk as a virus transmitter, consumer perceptions about safety persist: 53pc of global consumers surveyed by Worldpay said coronavirus made them more hesitant to use cash.\" The company's Pete Wickes added: \"This research shows the speed and scale of the transformation in consumer behaviour in just 12 months. The decline in the use of cash in the UK has accelerated, and while this opens up new opportunities for businesses to optimise and drive efficiencies, we need to be mindful that important parts of the economy continue to rely on cash, such as charity donations and restaurant tip jars.\" Do you think you will still be using cash in 2024?

But don\u2019t count out those pursuing targets in other industries, such as Foley Trasimene Acquisition II (NYSE:BFT) stock. Source: Sulastri Sulastri / Shutterstock.com This SPAC\u2019s sponsor, Bill Foley, may not have the clout of the most well-known \u201cSPAC Impresario,\u201d Chamath Palihapitiya. But Foley is fast becoming one of the more prolific SPAC sponsors out there. As InvestorPlace columnist David Moadel wrote in his Feb. 22 column, Trasimene Acquisition II is Foley\u2019s fourth SPAC. The first one (CF Corp) bought Fidelity & Guaranty Life, before getting acquired by Fidelity National Financial (NYSE:FIS), a company with which Foley was already involved.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Another one, Foley Trasimene Acquisition II, has announced a merger partner: payments processor Paysafe. More important than Foley\u2019s background is whether BFT stock can continue to climb once the Paysafe deal closes. After examining the details, I think that the shares can rise in the years ahead. BFT stock is worth buying today, but keep the risks it carries in mind. The \u201cSPAC bubble\u201d may be about to pop, resulting in some near-term volatility in the shares. BFT Stock and the Paysafe Deal Whenever assessing a SPAC stock that\u2019s announced a deal, your first question should be whether the deal terms make the shares worth investing in. To determine whether BFT stock is attractive, let\u2019s examine the details of its deal. 8 Stocks to Buy for March First, let\u2019s look at the overview of the transaction . At today\u2019s prices, the combined entity is valued at around $11.3 billion. Combined with the $1.8 billion of post-deal debt, the implied enterprise value of the shares is around $13.7 billion. Paysafe is expecting sales of around $1.5 billion and EBITDA of $561 million this year. In short, today\u2019s share price implies an EV/EBITDA ratio of around 25 times. That valuation is on par with that of similar companies, like Global Payments (NYSE:GPN). Also, Paysafe expects its EBITDA to reach $669 million to $744 million by 2023, around 20%-30% above its 2021 target. That suggests that BFT stock can gain 20%-30% in the coming years. The share price probably won\u2019t double or triple like a number of other SPACS have. But it could appreciate reasonably in the coming years. This SPAC\u2019s Risks On the other hand, there are several reasons why going long BFT stock today may not be profitable. Firstly, the valuation of payment processing plays could contract. Right now, the rapid growth of the online sports gambling market in the U.S. is helping to justify the high valuations of payment processors But if future years bring lower-than-expected growth for online sports gambling companies and iGaming operators, it may be tough for stocks like Paysafe to keep trading at their current EBITDA multiples. Secondly, the \u201cSPAC Bubble\u201d may be about to burst. That could push many blank-check stocks, including ones that have already announced deals, back towards their offering prices or even lower. While there\u2019s little investors can do about the first risk, the second one may have a silver lining. If the market gets skittish about SPACs and sells blank check stocks across the board, you may be able to take advantage of the situation and buy BFT stock at a more favorable entry point. The Bottom Line I don\u2019t see this SPAC becoming a \u201cmeme stock\u201d anytime soon. But, because it\u2019s reasonably priced, it may be a solid opportunity for long-term investors. Indeed, the shares could continue to climb, assuming the online gambling industry keeps expanding in the U.S. The risks posed by the name are more general to blank-check stocks, rather than company-specific issues. All in all, consider BFT stock a buy. On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not (either directly or indirectly) hold any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
