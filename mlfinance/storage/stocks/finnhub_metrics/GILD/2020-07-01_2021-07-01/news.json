Blackstone Group Inc.\u2019s Chairman Stephen Schwarzman said his private equity firm is committing $5 million to support India\u2019s Covid relief and vaccination services to \u201cmarginalized communities.\u201dWith haunting visuals of mass funeral pyres, long lines of ambulances outside overcrowded hospitals, and desperate pleas on social media for oxygen canisters, the unfolding tragedy is prompting some of the biggest corporations to organize aid for a country they view as a crucial market with 1.3 billion consumers. India\u2019s federal and state governments, grossly unprepared to tackle the latest coronavirus wave, have also encouraged the non-state sector to help narrow the vast chasm of shortages.Most critical has been the unavailability of medical oxygen, and a bulk of the efforts have been directed at boosting supplies. Ambani\u2019s Reliance, Tata Steel Ltd., ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India and JSW Steel Ltd. are among manufacturers that have diverted thousands of metric tons of liquid medical oxygen from their plants. Others such as consumer giant ITC Ltd. and the Adani Group -- controlled by India\u2019s second-richest man Gautam Adani -- are shipping in cryogenic tanks, and offering portable concentrators and generators.\u2018More Important\u2019\u201cSaving lives is more important than producing steel,\u201d said Sajjan Jindal, chairman of JSW Steel, the largest producer of the gas among the country\u2019s non-state companies in India.State-owned refiners Indian Oil Corp. and Bharat Petroleum Corp. chipped in with oxygen production as well.Underscoring the severity of the latest wave, official data on Wednesday showed new infections rose by 360,960 in the prior 24 hours, while 3,293 additional lives were lost -- both a record for the country. India has the world\u2019s fastest growing caseload. Total confirmed virus cases reached 18 million while deaths topped 200,000, and reports indicated both the numbers may be under counted.As the enormity of India\u2019s challenges shook the world, Indian-origin technology industry czars have extended help. Earlier this week, Silicon Valley investor Vinod Khosla tweeted an offer to fund public hospitals and import planeloads of bulk oxygen or supplies to India to improve stocks. A day later Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d by the situation in India and Microsoft is using its voice, resources and technology to aid relief efforts and help purchase oxygen concentrators.Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in a tweet that Google and its employees would rush medical supplies and support non-profits in a country that\u2019s a sizable market for its products. His company has proffered some $18 million in funding.Amazon is harnessing its global logistics supply chain to airlift 100 ICU ventilator units from the U.S., and the equipment will reach India in the next two weeks, the company\u2019s local chief Amit Agarwal said in a blog post. The e-commerce giant will help install, maintain and train personnel to use the machines, he said.Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook said the iPhone maker would donate relief but didn\u2019t provide details.Remdesivir AvailabilityGlobal drugmakers including Merck & Co. are licensing critical drugs to Indian generics manufacturers. Eli Lilly & Co. offered to donate Covid antibody drugs, while Gilead this week said it would expand the availability of Remdesivir, a drug used to treat symptoms of Covid-19.Several industry lobby groups are also jumping in. A collective of members of the prominent U.S. India Business Council plans to supply 20,000 oxygen concentrators in the coming weeks. The Confederation of Indian Industry, which counts the biggest Indian companies as members, is setting up a task force to augment supplies of oxygen.Digital payments startup Paytm said it will airlift 21,000 Oxygen concentrators by early May, and send it to government and private hospitals, and Covid care facilities.Ambani PhilanthropyThe Ambani family\u2019s Reliance Foundation has set up Covid care facilities with 875-bed capacity in Mumbai. The philanthropic arm of India\u2019s most valuable company will newly create, commission and manage 100 ICU beds that will become operational in mid-May. A team of over 500 staffers -- doctors, nurses and non-medical professionals -- will be deployed round-the-clock to tend to patients.In a phone interview from New York, Blackstone\u2019s Schwarzman said this is an \u201cexceptionally difficult situation\u201d for India, where the firm has a \u201clarge important business.\u201d Blackstone has invested billions of dollars in India and owns many of India\u2019s big office towers.\u201cEach country, both in the developed and developing world, had great troubles with Covid,\u201d he said. \u201cAll countries have learned lessons during Covid and I am sure India will adopt as many of these lessons as they can.\u201d(Adds detail in 14th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=0a374a68509fd75fc02e67ed2d4350dc95e62ce0b9441d072aebf8673de8b5eb"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619660880, "headline": "Notable companies reporting after market close", "id": 67119440, "image": "", "related": "GILD", "source": "Thefly.com", "summary": "Notable companies reporting after market close AMZN GILD VRTX TWTR KLAC FTNT SWKS ZEN NIO FIVN FSLR TXRH X", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e0e1551f7296a6ae0cc0bda9285d936181cc6484e5823548a8e85c6a82a31240"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619660340, "headline": "M.

Additionally, the company is donating at least 450,000 vials of Veklury to help Indian patients. Remdesivir is marketed in the US under the brand name Veklury. Gilead Sciences\u2019 Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier, said, \u201cThe recent surge of COVID-19 cases in India is having a devastating impact on communities and has created unprecedented pressure on health systems.\u201d Mercier added, \u201cOur immediate focus is to help address the needs of patients in India who may benefit from Remdesivir as quickly as we can by working together with the government, health authorities, and our voluntary licensees.\u201d (See Gilead stock analysis on TipRanks) All seven of Gilead\u2019s licensees in India have already ramped up Remdesivir production by increasing batch sizes, adding new production facilities, and taking on local contract manufacturers. In May 2020, Gilead established a licensing program to allow others to manufacture Remdesivir without owing royalties to Gilead. This has allowed more than 2.3 million people across 60-plus countries to be able to access the drug.

Syed will \u201clook for more granularity on the call regarding any potential growth driver\u201d and potential long-term guidance.
