The virtual event focuses on the core issues of climate change.The conference kicked off with speakers led by Bloomberg LP founder Michael R. Bloomberg and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore.Other presenters include BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink, actor Robin Wright, Jigar Shah, executive director of U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s loan programs office, and Ariel Investments Co-CEO Mellody Hobson. They are addressing the need for climate action and specific topics such as \u201cthe road to net zero\u201d and \u201cthe investor\u2019s case for climate action.\u201dClick here to register for the event.

But he said the company was holding off of major capital commitments until it had a better sense of whether the government would support them through either a price on carbon or a carbon tax.He also wants assurances that if such policy is implemented monies raised would go back into infrastructure and technology -- and not just into general government coffers.Fitterling said that if there was a price on carbon, it would have to be global or it would cripple America and Europe.\u201cIf we just follow Europe, you know, you run the potential that the United States and Europe could make themselves uncompetitive as manufacturers, and they could drive ball manufacturing to China, India, places that rely on coal and other forms of energy that would drive up greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d he said.For Unilever, 2050 Is Deadline for Net Zero, Not a Target Date (9:55 a.m. NY)For consumer goods giant Unilever, which has committed to reach net-zero emissions across its business by 2039, the mid-century target demanded by climate science for the global economy to zero out emissions should be seen less as a target date and more of a final deadline.\u201cThe significance of 2039 is really a response to the scale and the urgency of the climate crisis,\u201d said Marc Engel, Unilever\u2019s chief supply chain officer. \u201cWe very much see 2050 as a deadline, and not a target.\u201dThat\u2019s in part because not all companies will be able to cut net emissions to zero by 2050, so if some can get there earlier it will help everyone.\u201cThe climate crisis doesn\u2019t wait, and it knows no boundaries, so you either win together or you lose together,\u201d Engel said.Every company needs to play its part in the transition to a net-zero economy and they should take action right away, said Mindy Lubber, CEO of Ceres.\u201cWhen a company says, I\u2019m going to commit the next year or by 2050. Here\u2019s what we would say: That\u2019s great, but you can\u2019t start in 2043, you must have a short-term, a medium-term and a long-term set of goals,\u201d said Lubber. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just about bold, glorious, long-term solutions that may never happen. We have to ensure that we\u2019re not seeing greenwashing.\u201dAl Gore Says He\u2019s Optimitsic About Reaching \u2018Political Tipping Point\u2019 (9:25 a.m. NY)The global fight against climate change is accelerating and reaching a tipping point after a slow start, said Al Gore, former U.S. vice president and co-founder of Generation Investment Management.\u201cFrom the time the scientists started sounding the alarm, we\u2019ve waited way too long,\u201d Gore said. \u201cBut I\u2019m very optimistic that we\u2019re crossing the political tipping point right now.\u201dA combination of climate catastrophes such as fires and floods over the past few months have raised awareness among citizens in all latitudes about the need to act urgently against the fast warming of the planet, Gore said. At the same time, the sharp decline in the costs of clean technologies like wind and solar energy, and the outlook for electric vehicles are helping create momentum.\u201cWe\u2019re in the early stages of a revolution that has the magnitude of the industrial revolution,\u201d he said. \u201cMany are saying it\u2019s the biggest investment opportunity of all history.\u201dIn the past, financial firms looking to take advantage of the trend have sometimes made green promises they didn\u2019t keep, or tried to make polluting initiatives look clean for the environment, a phenomenon known as greenwashing, he said.\u201cESG investing has become mainstream and there is too much greenwashing,\u201d Gore said. \u201cBut this is different now because we\u2019ve seen the rise of public demands to get on with this.\u201dFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=9a218c00bdfed1ca1cf7a5ad8ec4ec961a57c75c21a1758959d83cc2583055c7"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619455740, "headline": "Dow Inc. stock rises Monday, still underperforms market", "id": 66712559, "image": "https://images.mktw.net/im-220105/social", "related": "DOW", "source": "MarketWatch", "summary": "Shares of Dow Inc. inched 0.14% higher to $62.20 Monday, on what proved to be an all-around mixed trading session for the stock market, with the S&P 500...", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a5e01759c8ff5aa3c573647c67b37c2a640799c977cefea240a28ea5e14c33c4"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619451603, "headline": "DOW vs. PPG: Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now?", "id": 66596691, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/T44Iwg7RbRrkaTIYz_liyQ--~B/aD00Njk7dz05MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/zacks.com/737ffb82e07dc8bffb77e72d153c91f2", "related": "DOW", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "DOW vs. PPG: Which Stock Is the Better Value Option?", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=10e4a5cb17ebf73a9a8fa91150aa0ad67b917c849e8f15b730e1a7fcb96f483a"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1619208600, "headline": "Companies that make things used to make things have seen earnings boosted by big jumps in prices.
