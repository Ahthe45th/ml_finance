And with economic activity reopening after the COVID pandemic, consumers are getting out, eager to spend, and holding plenty of pent-up savings and demand. It should really be a simple story of economic expansion \u2013 and, yet, unemployment remains stubbornly high.\n\n\n\nHedge fund billionaire Paul Tudor Jones finds the situation disconcerting. Jones notes that the Fed can use the 9.3 million job openings as support for a policy shift away from stimulus, and goes on to say, \u201cIt\u2019s an intellectual incongruity that risks damaging their forecasts if they\u2019re wrong on inflation... At the same time, right now we\u2019re instead quantitative easing and juicing an economy that\u2019s already red hot... You\u2019ve got the craziest mix of fiscal and monetary policy since the Federal Reserve Board was created.\u201d\n\n\n\nWatching the markets from Canaccord, Chief Market Strategist Tony Dwyer believes that Jones is basically correct. \n\n\n\n\u201cUntil there is more clarity from the Fed or a more definable trend in the market, we would continue to have a 'do no harm' view, which means not making any significant market or sector bets until there is a more definable edge during the summer of indigestion,\u201d Dwyer noted.\n\n\n\nFor the average retail investor, this adds up to a picture of confusion. It also points toward defensive stock moves. And that will bring us to dividends. By providing a steady income stream, no matter what the market conditions, a reliable dividend stock provides a pad for your investment portfolio when the share stop appreciating.\n\n\n\nWith this in mind, we\u2019ve used the TipRanks database to pinpoint three reliable dividend stocks -- big dividend payers that are currently yielding over 7% and have a reputation for maintaining steady payments. Wall Street\u2019s analysts say that these are solid stocks to buy. Let's take a closer look.\n\n\n\nAltria Group (MO)\n\n\n\nThe first dividend stock we're looking at is known for generating mixed emotions. Altria is a tobacco seller, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, making MO a classic \u2018sin stock.\u2019 Altria is also well-known as one of the stock market\u2019s long-time dividend champs, with a 12-year history of dividend growth.\n\n\n\nWhile smoking is the subject of enormous social pressures, Altria\u2019s top line hasn\u2019t suffered much in recent years. Quarterly revenues, since 2018, have fluctuated at or near the $5 billion mark, with Q1 typically showing the lowest revenue and Q3 the highest. The company reported $4.88 billion in revenues in its last quarterly report, for 1Q21, solidly in the historical pattern. EPS came in at 77 cents, down 7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\n\n\nIn 1Q21, the company\u2019s dividend payments totaled $1.6 billion. The dividend itself was declared at 86 cents per common share, or $3.44 annually, and yields 7%.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that Altria\u2019s continued growth and profits come even as the FDA and Biden Administration are making noises about banning menthol cigarettes. These are popular products, and a ban would hurt Altria\u2019s bottom line \u2013 but for now, it appears that the company, investors, and cigarette consumers are all shrugging off the possibility. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to note here, on the subject of tobacco product bans, that Altria is heavily invested in promoting the iQOS smokeless tobacco system. This past December, Altria announced that it had received FDA approval for commercialization of iQOS3, the latest version of the product.\n\n\n\nCovering Altria for Piper Sandler, Michael Lavery notes the regulatory risks ahead, but believes that Altria can roll with it. \n\n\n\n\u201cWe expect headline risk to remain in place for some time, but note that Altria looks best positioned if menthol is banned; 20% of its volumes are from menthol, vs. ~55% for BAT. Altria's iQOS could benefit; over 50% of its US sales are from menthol, and it should be much more established by the time any menthol ban could come into place,\u201d Lavery opined.\n\n\n\nLavery rates MO shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and gives the stock a price target of $57. At current levels, this implies an upside of 19% for the year ahead. (To watch Lavery\u2019s track record, click here)\n\n\n\nOverall, Wall Street is pretty upbeat about the company. TipRanks analysis of 12 analyst ratings shows a consensus Moderate Buy rating, with 8 analysts Buying and four recommending Hold. The average price target is $54.40, indicating room for a 15% upside from the current trading price of $47.22. (See MO stock analysis on TipRanks)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOmega Healthcare (OHI)\n\n\n\nAnd now we move on to the healthcare sector, where Omega operates as a real estate investment trust (REIT) with a focus on skilled nursing facilities and senior housing facilities. The company\u2019s portfolio boats a total of 954 facilities, located in 42 US states and the UK. Of Omega\u2019s properties, 78% are skilled nursing facilities, and 22% are senior housing. The portfolio has delivered a total return of 232% over the past decade, and Omega has increased its dividend regularly since 2003.\n\n\n\nThe company funds the dividend with solid financial results. In Q1, Omega report $164.4 million in net income, or 69 cents per share. This was up significantly from the year-ago quarter, which saw EPS of 42 cents.\n\n\n\nSeveral other key metrics were strong in the quarter, too. Omega collected over 99% of the rent and mortgage payments due it. The company sold 24 properties for $188 million, generating a net gain of $100 million. And it made $595 million worth of new acquisitions to the portfolio. At the end of all that, Omega\u2019s \u2018funds available for distribution,\u2019 the money available to cover the dividend, came in at $193.2 million.\n\n\n\nTurning to the dividend, Omega declared 67 cents per common share for the quarterly payment. This is the seventh quarter in a row with the dividend at this level. With an annualized payment of $2.68, the yield is just over 7%. Compared to the current interest rates, or to the ~2% average dividend in the broader markets, this is a solid return.\n\n\n\nBerenberg analyst Connor Siversky notes that the receding COVID pandemic has eased the pressure on skilled nursing and senior housing facilities, and he writes of Omega: \u201cWe expect occupancy gains to accelerate modestly into the summer months as the care delivery system works through a backlog of prospective SNF patients. Given positive occupancy trends and a reemergence of investment activity, we believe OHI\u2019s shares will perform well versus peers in near term as investors weigh the velocity of the burgeoning SNF recovery.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn line with those comments, Siversky rates OHI shares as a Buy, and his $41 price target implies a one-year upside potential of 13%. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~20% potential total return profile. (To watch Siversky\u2019s track record, click here)\n\n\n\nOverall, five analysts have weighed in on Omega recently, and their reviews include 3 Buys and 2 Holds, giving the stock a Moderate Buy analyst consensus rating. OHI is currently priced at $36.15 and its average target of $41.25 suggests a 14% upside from that level. (See OHI stock analysis on TipRanks)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAT&T, Inc. (T)\n\n\n\nLast of our list of dividend champs is AT&T, one of the corporate world\u2019s most recognizable names. The company got its start at the dawn of telecommunications, became a telephone monopoly during the last century, and was broken up under anti-trust actions in the 1980s. The modern company, operating since 2005, is a telecom and tech giant, with a market cap of $209 billion and more than $170 billion in annual revenue.\n\n\n\nAT&T\u2019s current business is highly diversified, and based in communications. The company retains a telephone service division, for both local and long distance landlines, and is a major provider of broadband services over both fiber-optic and wireless networks. AT&T is part of the accelerating 5G rollout in the US. In recent years, AT&T purchased Time Warner, and uses that library of entertainment content to support its streaming TV ventures.\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s recent Q1 report shows a sound foundation for investors to consider. At the top line, revenues came in at $43.9 billion, for a modest 2.7% yoy gain. EPS performed better; at $1.04, the earnings per share increased 65% from the year-ago quarter. And of interest for dividend investors, the company showed increased cash flows \u2013 the source of all dividend payments. Cash from operations was up 12% to $9.9 billion, and the free cash flow increased 51%, to $5.9 billion.\n\n\n\nDuring the quarter, AT&T declared a common share dividend of 52 cents. This was the sixth consecutive quarter at this rate for T\u2019s dividend, which has a 12-year history\u00a0of regular growth. The annualized payment, at $2.08, gives a dividend yield of 7.1%.\n\n\n\nIn his research note on AT&T, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft states his belief that the company has sound prospects. \n\n\n\n\u201cManagement has been taking steps to improve the company's focus: (1) centering its strategy and investment around areas where it can leverage its scale and differentiated assets to grow revenue/cash flow and create value (including wireless, fiber-based broadband, and HBO Max), (2) while at the same time balancing profitability by implementing cost transformation initiatives, and (3) monetizing non-core businesses (including DirecTV and Crunchyroll) to help fund these growth investments, while reducing management distraction,\" Kraft wrote.\n\n\n\nThe analyst summed up, \"We believe that AT&T's more concentrated strategy, and more recent relentless focus on execution, should drive sustained improvement in the company's fundamentals. With the stock trading at a relatively undemanding valuation and an attractive dividend yield, we see the opportunity for a healthy mid-teens % return.\"\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, Kraft, wrote, \u201cWe believe that AT&T's more concentrated strategy, and more recent relentless focus on execution, should drive sustained improvement in the company's fundamentals. With the stock trading at a relatively undemanding valuation and an attractive dividend yield, we see the opportunity for a healthy mid-teens % return over the next 12 months.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe analyst uses these comments to support a Buy rating on T shares, along with a $34 price target that implies room for ~17% upside. (To watch Kraft\u2019s track record, click here)\n\n\n\nSo, that\u2019s Deutsche Bank's view, let\u2019s turn our attention now to rest of the Street: T's 7 Buys, 5 Holds and 2 Sell coalesce into a Moderate Buy rating. The stock is currently priced at $29.13 and its $32.17 average price target suggests it has a 10% upside ahead of it.

The agency said years ago it would consider lowering nicotine levels in cigarettes. The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that the Biden administration agency is considering the ban, along with requirements to lower nicotine content, citing people familiar with the matter.Marlboro producer Altria Group Inc. fell as much as 6.9% Tuesday, losing more than $11 billion in market value since Friday. British American Tobacco Plc dropped as much as 8.3% in London Tuesday. Analysts estimate the maker of Lucky Strike cigarettes gets as much as a third of its earnings from menthol brands such as Newport.The FDA declined to comment on the report on Monday. The Wall Street Journal said the Biden administration is weighing whether to enact a menthol ban or nicotine restrictions, or both.Imperial Brands Plc, which makes Kool cigarettes, fell as much as 7.5%. Stock of 22nd Century Group Inc., which already sells cigarettes with very low nicotine levels, extended Monday\u2019s 11% gain.The industry has been anticipating an FDA decision about nicotine levels in cigarettes for years. The agency declared in 2018 that it intended to do so, prompting Altria to question whether that\u2019s technically achievable and if that would effectively reduce smoking. Since then, 22nd Century Group, based in Williamsville, New York, has come out with reduced-nicotine cigarettes.Philip Morris International Inc. was little changed Tuesday after raising its outlook for the year amid stronger demand for its IQOS cigarette alternative. Philip Morris, which doesn\u2019t sell cigarettes in the U.S., dropped only 1.3% Monday, outperforming rivals on the prospect that tighter tobacco rules could spur demand for IQOS. Altria sells the product in the U.S. through an alliance.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysThe notion of a federal mandate to cut nicotine levels in U.S. cigarettes would impair Altria most, considering it controls 53% of the $90 billion domestic market, though we believe such a requirement would be years away and face fierce legal challenges.-- Kenneth Shea, BI senior analystIn an email, Altria said any FDA action \u201cmust be based on science and evidence and must consider the real-world consequences of such actions, including the growth of an illicit market and the impact on hundreds of thousands of jobs.\u201dThe proposal on nicotine is serious, but politically would be difficult to pull off, according to Adam Spielman, an analyst at Citigroup. Some 15% of voters smoke, and such a move could cost Democrats large numbers of blue-collar votes.\u201cWe suspect that this idea will continue to be discussed for decades, but we would be extremely surprised if it were implemented in the next 10 or even 15 years,\u201d he wrote in a note.BAT\u2019s Reynolds unit said there are better ways to improve public health and reduce the harm from tobacco.\u201cMany consumers wrongly believe that a cigarette very low in nicotine content is lower in risk than traditional cigarettes, a misconception that poses a major hurdle in determining proposed rulemaking for low nicotine cigarettes,\u201d the company said.One issue is that such a rule might lead some smokers to consume more cigarettes as they seek a fix to their nicotine cravings, inhaling more dangerous chemicals in the process. It could also create a black market for more powerful cigarettes.The FDA has been expected to state its position on whether it would still allow menthol cigarettes by April 29, under a deadline imposed by a lawsuit. The case, brought by the African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council, had sued the government agency saying it had taken an unreasonably long time to respond to a citizen\u2019s petition filed years ago that sought to prohibit menthol as a flavor in cigarettes.(Updates shares in third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=dde519be4a42e3937f0f0cea104d01c854d2d6ee85557253acd530a9cbfd7682"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1618927243, "headline": "Dow Jones Today, Stocks Open Lower: Nike Hits China Friction; Kansas City Southern Spikes On $30 Bil.
