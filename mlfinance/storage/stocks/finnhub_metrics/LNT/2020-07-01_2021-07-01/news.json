(Corporate Services) operations generated $0.66 per share of GAAP EPS in the first quarter of 2021, which was $0.06 per share lower than the first quarter of 2020. The primary drivers of lower EPS were timing of income tax expense, higher depreciation expense and lower allowance for funds used during construction in the first quarter of 2021. These impacts were partially offset by higher earnings resulting from IPL\u2019s and WPL\u2019s increasing rate base and higher electric and gas sales volumes largely caused by colder temperatures in the first quarter of 2021 compared to last year. Non-utility and Parent - Alliant Energy\u2019s Non-utility and Parent operations generated ($0.01) per share of GAAP EPS in the first quarter of 2021, which was a $0.04 per share earnings increase compared to the first quarter of 2020. The higher EPS was primarily driven by a $0.02 per share credit loss charge in the first quarter of 2020 related to guarantees associated with an affiliate of Whiting Petroleum Corporation (Whiting Petroleum). Earnings Adjustments - Non-GAAP EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2020 excludes charges of $0.02 per share related to the credit loss charge described above for Alliant Energy\u2019s Non-utility and Parent. Non-GAAP adjustments, which relate to material charges or income that are not normally associated with ongoing operations, are provided as a supplement to results reported in accordance with GAAP. Details regarding GAAP EPS variances between the first quarters of 2021 and 2020 for Alliant Energy are as follows: VarianceHigher revenue requirements primarily due to increasing rate base $0.08 Timing of income tax expense (0.05) Higher depreciation expense (0.05) Lower allowance for funds used during construction (0.05) Estimated temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales 0.04 Equity dilution (0.02) Credit loss charge on guarantees for affiliate of Whiting Petroleum in 2020 0.02 Other 0.01 Total ($0.02) Higher revenue requirements primarily due to increasing rate base - In 2020, IPL received a final order from the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) to increase annual rates for its Iowa retail electric customers based on a 2020 forward-looking Test Period. Effective with the implementation of final rates covering the 2020 forward-looking Test Period on February 26, 2020, IPL began recovering a return of, as well as earning a return on, its new wind generation placed in service in 2019 and 2020 from its retail electric customers through a renewable energy rider. Other applicable costs and tax benefits associated with the new wind generation, excluding operation and maintenance expenses, are also included in the rider. The renewable energy rider factor is updated on an annual basis using forecasted rate base and costs for the current year. The 2021 renewable energy rider factor includes the full impact of the wind expansion completed in 2020, resulting in increased earnings for 2021. IPL recognized a $0.04 per share increase in the first quarter of 2021 due to the higher revenue requirements from increasing rate base related to the new wind generation and electric distribution investments. This increasing rate base at IPL also resulted in higher depreciation expense and lower allowance for funds used during construction in the first quarter 2021. In December 2020, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin issued an order authorizing WPL to maintain its current retail electric and gas base rates, authorized return on equity, regulatory capital structure and earnings sharing mechanism through the end of 2021. WPL will utilize anticipated fuel-related cost savings and excess deferred income tax benefits in 2021 to offset the revenue requirement impacts of increasing electric and gas rate base. WPL recognized a $0.04 per share increase in the first quarter of 2021 due to higher revenue requirements from increasing electric and gas rate base. This increasing rate base at WPL was primarily attributable to its Kossuth wind farm, which was placed in service in October 2020, and the expansion of its gas distribution system in Western Wisconsin, which was placed in service in November 2020. This increasing rate base at WPL also resulted in higher depreciation expense and lower allowance for funds used during construction in the first quarter 2021. Timing of income tax expense - Income tax expense is recorded each quarter based on an estimated annual effective tax rate and the proportion of full year earnings generated each quarter, which is expected to cause fluctuations in the amount of tax expense quarter-over-quarter throughout 2021. In the first quarter of 2021, the timing variance impact was a decrease of $0.05 per share compared to the first quarter of 2020. The timing variance is expected to be reversed by the end of the year. Estimated temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales - Alliant Energy\u2019s retail electric and gas sales modestly increased in the first quarter of 2021 due to impacts of colder than normal temperatures on customer demand. The estimated temperature impacts on retail electric and gas sales was a $0.01 per share increase in the first quarter of 2021, compared to a $0.03 per share decrease in the first quarter of 2020. Credit loss charge on guarantees for affiliate of Whiting Petroleum in 2020 - A wholly-owned subsidiary of Alliant Energy continues to guarantee the partnership obligations of an affiliate of Whiting Petroleum under multiple general partnership agreements. The partnership obligations include costs associated with the future abandonment of certain facilities owned by the partnerships. Alliant Energy recorded a $0.02 per share charge in the first quarter of 2020 related to expected credit losses related to the guarantees. 2021 Earnings Guidance Alliant Energy\u2019s consolidated EPS guidance of $2.50 - $2.64 for 2021 remains unchanged. Drivers for Alliant Energy\u2019s 2021 earnings guidance include, but are not limited to: Ability of IPL and WPL to earn their authorized rates of returnStable economy and resulting implications on utility salesNormal temperatures in its utility service territoriesExecution of cost controlsExecution of capital expenditure and financing plansConsolidated effective tax rate of (19%) The 2021 earnings guidance does not include the impacts of any material non-cash valuation adjustments, regulatory-related charges or credits, reorganizations or restructurings, future changes in laws, regulations or regulatory policies, adjustments made to deferred tax assets and liabilities from valuation allowances, changes in credit loss liabilities related to guarantees, pending lawsuits and disputes, federal and state income tax audits and other Internal Revenue Service proceedings, or changes in GAAP and tax methods of accounting that may impact the reported results of Alliant Energy.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures To provide investors with additional information regarding Alliant Energy\u2019s financial results, this press release includes reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures include income and EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2020 excluding a credit loss charge on guarantees for an affiliate of Whiting Petroleum. Alliant Energy believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors because it provides an alternate measure to better understand and compare across periods the operating performance of Alliant Energy without the distortion of items that management believes are not normally associated with ongoing operations, and also provides additional information about Alliant Energy\u2019s operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance. Alliant Energy\u2019s management also uses income, as adjusted, to determine performance-based compensation. In addition, Alliant Energy included in this press release IPL; WPL; Corporate Services; Utilities and Corporate Services; ATC Holdings; and Non-utility and Parent EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. Alliant Energy believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of segment performance and trends, and provide additional information about Alliant Energy\u2019s operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance.

Alliant Energy has a settlement in principle with several Wisconsin-based stakeholder organizations, including the Citizens Utility Board (CUB), Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group (WIEG) and Sierra Club, which further manages customer costs and enables a thoughtful transition to clean energy. During the two years covered by the settlement in principle, Alliant Energy anticipates placing nearly 1,100 megawatts of new solar generation into service in Wisconsin; the company\u2019s utility-scale solar plans are currently under review by the PSCW. The settlement in principle further aligns rate increases in Wisconsin with customer cost savings, particularly related to retiring the Edgewater 5 coal facility. The agreement also reflects the company\u2019s continued operation and maintenance cost management practices. \u201cWe appreciate the constructive discussions with our stakeholders as we focus on following the path outlined in our Clean Energy Blueprint,\u201d said David de Leon, President of Alliant Energy's Wisconsin energy company. \u201cGuided by our purpose-driven strategy, we look forward to continuing these conversations and doing what\u2019s right for our customers while helping to build stronger communities.\u201d Over the last decade, Alliant Energy\u2019s Wisconsin residential electric customers have experienced an average rate increase of less than 1%, year over year, while residential natural gas customers in the state have experienced, on average, a decrease of nearly 2% per year. The conversation between Alliant Energy and stakeholders is ongoing; however, in principle, the groups have reached tentative agreement on: Covering two test years (2022 and 2023), which enables Alliant Energy to hold electric base rates flat in 2023, avoiding an otherwise anticipated base rate increase.An overall increase in revenue requirements in 2022 of $70M for the electric utility and $15M for the gas utility.Implementing a financial equity layer of 52.5% and maintaining its presently authorized return on equity (10%).Levelized recovery of 100% of the remaining net book value balance of the Edgewater Unit 5 plant, after it retires in 2022 using a 9.8% ROE to calculate the revenue requirement. The levelized recovery mechanism results in an effective ROE of 9.2% on the plant following retirement and provides customers near-term savings. The parties continue to finalize the terms of the settlement, including discussing rate design and cost allocation issues. The settlement will be subject to review and approval by the PSCW. Alliant Energy plans to outline additional details in their rate review filing, which the company expects to submit this month. Once filed, Alliant Energy\u2019s rate review will be available on the PSCW\u2019s electronic filing system under Docket No. 6680-UR-123.

This rounds out the company\u2019s previously announced plan to accelerate its transition to clean energy by adding more than 1,000 MW of solar while helping customers avoid more than $2 billion in long-term costs. Upon completion of their more than 1,000 MW of solar, Alliant Energy will own and operate the most solar energy in the state of Wisconsin. \u201cGuided by our purpose-driven strategy to serve customers and build strong communities, we are accelerating our transition to cleaner energy,\u201d stated David de Leon, President of Alliant Energy's Wisconsin energy company. \u201cThis continued transition is a smart investment, benefitting our customers long-term, while also creating hundreds of jobs across the state and providing local communities with shared-revenues.\u201d The six new projects will be developed in mostly rural parts of Dodge, Grant, Green, Rock and Waushara counties. Once the projects are operational, local communities will receive an estimated $50 million in shared revenues \u2013 for the next 30 years \u2013 to use in a variety of ways, such as funding local fire departments, investing in school programs and upgrading park facilities. Additionally, local landowners will receive a combined $60 million in lease payments over 30 years. The additional projects, five of which are being self-developed by Alliant Energy, are expected to create more than 800 local construction jobs across the five counties. They include: Solar Project NameCountySizeAlbanyGreen50 megawattsBeaver DamDodge50 megawattsCassvilleGrant50 megawattsPaddockRock65 megawattsSpringfield (under development by National Grid Renewables)Dodge100 megawattsWautomaWaushara99 megawatts \u201cThis provides tremendous potential for these communities,\u201d said Mike Koles, Executive Director of the Wisconsin Towns Association. \u201cBased on research and dialogue with our members that have partnered with Alliant Energy on previous solar projects, we\u2019ve concluded that Alliant Energy\u2019s development process has been overwhelmingly positive and illustrates model developer behavior that should be mimicked in future solar project planning.\u201d Today\u2019s announcement comes as Alliant Energy awaits approval on the Certificate of Authority application they filed with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) in May 2020. In that application, the company announced plans to acquire and advance six solar projects that would add 675 MW of solar energy by the end of 2023. In total, the 12 planned solar projects will power hundreds of thousands of homes across the state. Along with the large, utility-scale solar projects, Alliant Energy has made several community-based solar announcements in recent months, including projects in Sheboygan, Fond du Lac and Dane County. Collectively, the company\u2019s transition to solar is outlined in its Clean Energy Blueprint \u2013 Alliant Energy\u2019s strategic roadmap to cost-effectively accelerate their use of renewables. It also serves as the company\u2019s guide as they continue to diversify their energy mix to ensure reliability and resiliency \u2013 no matter the weather. Once these 12 projects are fully built out, Alliant Energy estimates that, by 2025, nearly half of their resource mix will be made up of renewable resources (wind, hydro and solar). Combined with upcoming retirements of the Edgewater Generating Station and Columbia Energy Center, Alliant Energy is well-positioned to achieve its goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions from fossil-fueled generation by 50 percent by 2030 from 2005 levels. \u201cIt\u2019s great for our environment and aligns with our company\u2019s values, which include Make Things Better and Do the Right Thing,\u201d added de Leon. Alliant Energy will file its Certificate of Authority application with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) to advance these projects; docket number 6680-CE-183.

In 2020, we completed our historic wind expansion and announced plans to invest in over 1,400 megawatts of solar, continuing to be one of the industry leaders in the advancement of renewable energy,\u201d said John Larsen, Alliant Energy Chairman, President and CEO. \u201cConsistent with our 5 to 7% long-term earnings growth goal, our 2020 temperature normalized non-GAAP earnings per share increased 7% over calendar year 2019.\u201d Utilities and Corporate Services - Alliant Energy\u2019s Utilities and Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc. (Corporate Services) operations generated $2.36 per share of GAAP EPS in 2020, which was $0.14 per share higher than 2019. The primary driver of higher EPS was higher earnings resulting from Interstate Power and Light Company\u2019s (IPL\u2019s) and Wisconsin Power and Light Company\u2019s (WPL\u2019s) increasing rate base. This item was partially offset by higher depreciation expense, lower allowance for funds used during construction, equity dilution, and higher WPL electric fuel-related costs, net of recoveries. Earnings Adjustments - Non-GAAP EPS for 2020 excludes $0.02 per share related to credit loss adjustments on a guarantee for an affiliate of Whiting Petroleum Corporation (Whiting Petroleum) and $0.02 per share related to a tax valuation allowance adjustment, both for Alliant Energy\u2019s Non-utility and Parent. Non-GAAP EPS for 2019 excludes earnings of $0.02 per share related to ATC return on equity (ROE) reserve adjustments due to a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decision in the fourth quarter of 2019 regarding Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. transmission owners\u2019 authorized ROE. Non-GAAP adjustments, which relate to material charges or income that are not normally associated with ongoing operations, are provided as a supplement to results reported in accordance with GAAP. Temperature Impacts to Non-GAAP EPS - The estimated net impacts of temperatures on retail electric and gas sales were $0.01 per share and $0.05 per share gains in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The temperature-normalized non-GAAP EPS was $2.42 per share and $2.26 per share for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Details regarding GAAP EPS variances between 2020 and 2019 for Alliant Energy are as follows: 2020 2019 VarianceHigher revenue requirements primarily due to increasing rate base $0.62 Higher depreciation expense (0.15)Lower allowance for funds used during construction (0.11)Equity dilution (0.10)(Higher) lower WPL electric fuel-related costs, net of recoveries($0.04) $0.02 (0.06)Net temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales 0.01 0.05 (0.04)Credit loss adjustments on guarantee for affiliate of Whiting Petroleum in 2020 0.02 \u2014 0.02 Tax valuation allowance adjustment in 2020 0.02 \u2014 0.02 ATC ROE reserve adjustments in 2019 \u2014 0.02 (0.02)Other (0.04)Total Alliant Energy Consolidated $0.14 Higher revenue requirements primarily due to increasing rate base - In March 2019, IPL filed a request with the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) to increase annual rates for its Iowa retail electric and gas customers, based on a 2020 forward-looking test period. An interim retail electric rate increase was implemented effective April 2019. The IUB approved settlement agreements to increase retail gas and electric rates, which were implemented on January 10, 2020 and February 26, 2020, respectively. IPL recognized $0.40 per share increase due to higher revenue requirements from increasing rate base. Increasing rate base at IPL is primarily attributed to its new wind generation projects. These investments have also increased depreciation expense and reduced fuel costs. In December 2018, WPL received an order from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approving WPL\u2019s proposed settlement for its retail electric and gas rate review covering the 2019/2020 Test Period. Under the settlement, WPL\u2019s retail electric and gas base rates did not change from 2018 levels through the end of 2020. The retail electric revenue requirement increase, resulting from increasing investments in rate base, was offset by federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 benefits and lower fuel-related costs. WPL recognized a $0.22 per share increase in 2020 due to higher revenue requirements from increasing rate base. Increasing rate base at WPL is primarily attributed to its West Riverside expansion project. This investment has also increased depreciation expense and reduced fuel costs. Net temperature impact of retail electric and gas sales - Alliant Energy\u2019s retail electric and gas sales increased in 2020 and 2019 due to impacts of temperatures on customer demand. WPL\u2019s 2019 retail electric and gas rate orders included an earnings sharing mechanism whereby WPL must defer a portion of its earnings and return this amount to its retail electric and gas customers if its annual regulatory return on common equity exceeds 10.25%. As a result, a portion of the higher margins recognized at WPL due to the temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales in 2019 is expected to be returned to customers in a future year. A portion of Alliant Energy\u2019s incentive pay is based on earnings. As a result, a portion of the higher earnings resulting from the temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales in 2019 was offset by higher incentive pay expense. Alliant Energy\u2019s estimated temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales, net of the WPL earnings sharing mechanism and the portion of incentive pay associated with temperature impacts on earnings, was estimated to be a $0.05 per share increase in earnings in 2019. In 2020, no adjustments were made to the temperature impact of electric and gas sales. Credit loss adjustment on guarantee for affiliate of Whiting Petroleum - A wholly-owned subsidiary of Alliant Energy continues to guarantee the partnership obligations of an affiliate of Whiting Petroleum under multiple general partnership agreements it maintains within the oil industry. The partnership obligations include costs associated with the future abandonment of certain facilities owned by the partnerships. Whiting Petroleum completed its bankruptcy proceedings in the third quarter of 2020. Alliant Energy estimates a decrease in the current expected credit loss related to the guarantees and has recognized $0.02 per share of earnings in 2020. Tax valuation allowance adjustment - In prior years, valuation allowances related to certain tax credit carryforwards were recorded, since it was expected they would expire before utilized. Based on updated taxable income projections, it was determined that a portion of these credits would be utilized before they expire. Alliant Energy recognized a $0.02 per share increase of earnings in 2020 as a result of reversing a portion of the valuation allowance. 2021 Earnings Guidance Alliant Energy\u2019s consolidated guidance of $2.50 to $2.64 earnings per share for 2021 remains unchanged. Drivers for Alliant Energy\u2019s 2021 earnings guidance include, but are not limited to: Ability of IPL and WPL to earn their authorized rates of returnStable economy and resulting implications on utility salesAbility to mitigate adverse impacts of COVID-19Normal temperatures in its utility service territoriesExecution of cost controlsExecution of capital expenditure and financing plansConsolidated effective tax rate of (20%) The 2021 earnings guidance does not include the impacts of any material non-cash valuation adjustments, regulatory-related charges or credits, reorganizations or restructurings, future changes in laws, regulations or regulatory policies, adjustments made to deferred tax assets and liabilities from valuation allowances, changes in credit loss liabilities related to guarantees, pending lawsuits and disputes, federal and state income tax audits and other Internal Revenue Service proceedings, or changes in GAAP and tax methods of accounting that may impact the reported results of Alliant Energy.

Without limitation, the expectations with respect to 2021 earnings guidance in this press release are forward-looking statements and are based in part on certain assumptions made by Alliant Energy, some of which are referred to in the forward-looking statements. Alliant Energy cannot provide any assurance that the assumptions referred to in the forward-looking statements or otherwise are accurate or will prove to be correct. Any assumptions that are inaccurate or do not prove to be correct could have a material adverse effect on Alliant Energy\u2019s ability to achieve the estimates or other targets included in the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included herein are made as of the date hereof and, except as required by law, Alliant Energy undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures To provide investors with additional information regarding Alliant Energy\u2019s financial results, this press release includes reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures include the use of (1) income and EPS for year ended December 31, 2020 excluding credit loss adjustments on a guarantee for an affiliate of Whiting Petroleum and a tax valuation allowance adjustment; (2) income and EPS for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020 excluding a tax valuation allowance adjustment; and (3) income and EPS for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2019 excluding the ATC ROE reserve adjustments. Alliant Energy believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they provide an alternate measure to better understand and compare across periods the operating performance of Alliant Energy without the distortion of items that management believes are not normally associated with ongoing operations, and also provide additional information about Alliant Energy\u2019s operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance. Alliant Energy\u2019s management also uses income, as adjusted, to determine performance-based compensation. In addition, Alliant Energy included in this press release IPL; WPL; Corporate Services; Utilities and Corporate Services; ATC Holdings; and Non-utility and Parent EPS for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Alliant Energy believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of segment performance and trends, and provide additional information about Alliant Energy\u2019s operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance. This press release references year-over-year variances in utility electric margins and utility gas margins. Utility electric margins and utility gas margins are non-GAAP financial measures that will be reported and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, operating income, in our 2020 Form 10-K. This press release also includes temperature-normalized non-GAAP EPS for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Alliant Energy believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors because the measure facilitates period-to-period comparison of Alliant Energy\u2019s operating performance and provides investors with information on a basis consistent with measures that management uses to assess Alliant Energy\u2019s earnings growth rate. The tax impact adjustments represent the impact of the tax effect of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments excluded from non-GAAP net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments is calculated based on the estimated consolidated statutory tax rate. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the earnings summaries that follow, and in the case of temperature-normalized non-GAAP EPS, in the press release above. Note: Unless otherwise noted, all \u201cper share\u201d references in this release refer to earnings per diluted share.

Benzinga's report can help you figure out the ins and outs of the earnings release. Net Income, Earnings, And Earnings Per Share Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. Earnings And Revenue Analysts expect Alliant Energy earnings of $0.23 per share. Revenue will likely be around $1.12 billion, according to the consensus estimate. In the same quarter last year, Alliant Energy reported EPS of $0.44 on revenue of $880.10 million. Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the \"consensus estimates.\" A company posting earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate is known as an \"earnings surprise\" and may move the stock by a considerable margin. View more earnings on LNT If the company were to match the consensus estimate, earnings would be down 47.73%. Revenue would be up 27.26% on a year-over-year basis. Here is how the company's reported EPS has compared to analyst estimates in the past: Quarter Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 EPS Estimate 0.90 0.46 0.54 0.43 EPS Actual 0.94 0.54 0.72 0.44 Revenue Estimate 974.23 M 806.48 M 1.02 B 938.16 M Revenue Actual 920.00 M 763.10 M 915.70 M 880.10 M Stock Performance Shares of Alliant Energy were trading at $47.82 as of February 16. Over the last 52-week period, shares are down 19.31%. Given that these returns are generally negative, long-term shareholders are probably upset going into this earnings release. Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call. Alliant Energy is scheduled to hold the call at 13:00:00 ET and can be accessed here.

And we will continue to support organizations and initiatives that make a difference in our communities in 2021 and beyond.\u201d In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, racial injustice and the unprecedented derecho storm, Alliant Energy and its Foundation found innovative ways to quickly help meet the ongoing needs of customers and communities. Their ongoing giving programs provided further assistance. COVID-19 pandemicAs the COVID-19 pandemic carries into 2021, Alliant Energy and its Foundation continue to evaluate opportunities to help customers and communities. In 2020, over $340,000 was donated to food banks, community action agencies, United Ways and other nonprofit organizations helping customers throughout the pandemic. Thousands of face shields and face masks were produced and provided to healthcare facilities and schools. Over 40,000 diapers were collected for local families through an employee diaper drive. To aid nonprofits and small businesses, they funded virtual free Business Survival Coaching sessions, led by the Creative Adventure Lab. Racial injusticeTo help ensure equal rights for historically under-represented groups, Alliant Energy and its Foundation emphasize diversity and inclusion. In 2020, cornerstones of their giving included the Madison YWCA\u2019s 2020 Racial Justice Summit and continued longtime partnerships with the Madison Region Economic Partnership and the African American Museum of Iowa. They also donated $15,000 to the Black Enterprise Fund, dedicated to empowering the Black community of Dane County, Wisconsin. Derecho storm recoveryThe unprecedented derecho storm caused widespread power outages on August 10. Alliant Energy and its Foundation continue to help customers and communities throughout ongoing recovery efforts. Soon after the storm, Project ReConnect was launched to assist Iowa customers who needed electrical repairs before power could be fully restored to their homes. Alliant Energy employees, retirees, board of directors and Foundation donated $315,000 to the program. In late 2020, Project ReConnect expanded to provide housing repair assistance. Alliant Energy and its Foundation also contributed funds to assist with emergency relief and provided food for communities impacted by the derecho. Community GrantsNearly $900,000 was awarded to over 375 organizations through the Community Grants program. The grants supported local projects in the following focus areas: Hunger and Housing, Workforce Readiness, Environmental Stewardship, and Diversity, Safety and Well-Being. Fight against hungerNutrition-related giving to fight hunger and provide food for families generated nearly two million meals. The Foundation\u2019s annual Drive Out Hunger golf event, held virtually in 2020, raised $385,000 and supplied 1.5 million meals to seven food banks. Through a $100,000 donation, 2,000 holiday food boxes were delivered to vulnerable families in 14 different communities in December. Employee giving and volunteeringAlliant Energy encourages employees and retirees to donate to local organizations. Through an employee Matching Gifts program, more than $1.4 million was donated to nonprofits in 2020. Despite the challenges of volunteering due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Alliant Energy\u2019s employees found safe ways to volunteer by delivering meals, calling seniors to keep them company and mentoring students online. As a result, employees and retirees volunteered over 64,000 hours to give back to local communities, resulting in over $1.7 million in economic value. ScholarshipsOver 130 students received scholarships from Alliant Energy, totaling more than $120,000. These scholarships help students ease the financial burden of going to college and local communities develop their future workforce. Alliant Energy is currently seeking applications for their 2021 Innovation Scholarships. Up to 25 students will receive a $1,000 scholarship to recognize their outstanding community leadership. Applications must be submitted online at scholarsapply.org/alliantenergyinnovation by February 17 at 3 p.m. \u201cWe are proud to serve our customers, support local communities and do all we can to help improve lives,\u201d said Julie Bauer, Executive Director of the Alliant Energy Foundation. \u201cIt takes everyone working together to make our communities stronger.\u201d For more information about Alliant Energy and its Foundation, visit alliantenergy.com/foundation.

Located near Portage in Columbia County, the Columbia Energy Center has generated reliable, affordable power for Wisconsin customers for nearly half a century. \u201cThe closure of Columbia is truly a historic moment as we stop burning coal in our Wisconsin Operations and fully turn our attention to generating cleaner energy using renewable resources, such as solar, battery storage and high efficiency gas,\u201d said David de Leon, President of Alliant Energy's Wisconsin energy company. \u201cWhile we are pleased to reach agreement with the co-owners on this retirement date for the facility, we will not be hasty in the final years of operation. We will take care of our employees and provide career assistance to those who are interested while tending to the community we so proudly serve.\u201d According to de Leon, this decision \u2013 to retire Columbia by the end of 2024 \u2013 will help keep costs down for customers. In fact, over the next decade, the company expects to avoid more than $250 million in expenses that would otherwise be required to keep Columbia efficient and operational. He added, \u201cIn other words, these savings will keep costs affordable for the long-term while we continue to safely and reliably deliver the energy our customers expect.\u201d The Columbia Energy Center, which went into operation in 1975, is capable of generating more than 1,100 megawatts of energy. Retiring the facility by the end of 2024 positions Alliant Energy to achieve its Clean Energy Vision, including a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 and eliminating all coal from their generation fleet by 2040. Similar to the services the company is providing to employees at other coal-fired facilities they are retiring, Alliant Energy will hold one-on-one meetings, offer opportunities, tuition reimbursement and provide other resources geared toward the individual and unique needs of each employee. In addition to caring for employees, Alliant Energy will work closely with community leaders to determine the best use of the site along with ways to continue supporting the economic health of the community. For Alliant Energy, it\u2019s about staying true to their purpose-driven strategy: Supporting customers and building strong communities. The retirement of Columbia is part of Alliant Energy\u2019s Clean Energy Blueprint, a roadmap that outlines the company\u2019s acceleration toward using more renewable energy. This plan is the result of an extensive and holistic resource planning process that Alliant Energy initiated, during which it sought and received feedback from stakeholders representing a variety of constituencies in Wisconsin\u2019s energy sector. It also includes adding community solar, customer hosted solar and battery storage pilots along with at least 1,000 megawatts of new utility-scale solar in Wisconsin. The company views their Blueprint as an economic catalyst that is creating jobs and building stronger communities while also creating a healthier environment. \u201cBy acting now to move away from coal to clean energy, Alliant Energy is putting words into action at a critical time,\u201d said Elizabeth Katt Reinders, Deputy Director of Sierra Club\u2019s Beyond Coal Campaign. \u201cAlliant Energy\u2019s Blueprint shows how comprehensive resource planning can deliver hundreds of millions of dollars of avoided costs to customers. This process, which included robust stakeholder engagement and advanced modeling tools, led to the decision to retire Columbia by the end of 2024 and replace that power with clean energy. This demonstrates their commitment to keeping costs down for customers, contributing to the growing renewable energy job economy, and doing it in a way that is supportive of their employees and the communities they serve.\u201d Last May, Alliant Energy announced plans for 675 megawatts of solar energy generation; in the coming months, the company expects to announce details about the next phase of their solar plans. \u201cAs we accelerate our transition toward a cleaner energy mix, we continue to be guided by our purpose-driven strategy and our Clean Energy Vision,\u201d added de Leon. \u201cThis long-term vision is driven by our values to Do the right thing and Act for tomorrow. It\u2019s a smart investment for our customers because it keeps rates affordable in the long run, creates new jobs and brings new economic development opportunities to the communities we serve.\u201d Alliant Energy co-owns the Columbia facility with Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, a subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, and Madison Gas and Electric Company. Collectively, the utility companies intend to retire Unit 1 by the end of 2023 and Unit 2 by the end of 2024. Final timing and retirement dates for Units 1 and 2 are subject to additional state and regional regulatory reviews. For more information about Alliant Energy visit AlliantEnergy.com.

The company's crews and contractors have fixed hundreds of streetlights. \n \"That will continue until every single one of those lights are back on,\" Farlinger said. \n Alliant has 12 two-person crews dedicated for streetlight repairs in \"every quadrant of the city.\" \n Fewer daylight hours and colder weather has not affected the workers' ability to repair lights. \n \"If it's negative 20 degrees, they're not going to be working outside that day,\" Farlinger said. \"But we should be able to get a good chunk, if not all of this work done before the weather turns really bad.\" \n The level of damage has varied between neighborhoods, with some areas having half of the lights out. Some streetlights need to be completely replaced, while others can be restored by fixing a span of wire. \n Alliant is also dedicating many of its crews to restoring power to customers who needed extensive electrical repairs before Alliant could resume power. \n \"They're still calling to say, 'Hey, I'm ready to take service now.
