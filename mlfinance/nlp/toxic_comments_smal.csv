Why the edits made under my username Hardcore Metallica Fan were reverted? They weren't vandalisms, just closure on some GAs after I voted at New York Dolls FAC. And please don't remove the template from the talk page since I'm retired now.89.205.38.27",0,0,0,0,0,1

I can't make any real suggestions on improvement - I wondered if the section statistics should be later on, or a subsection of """"types of accidents""""  -I think the references may need tidying so that they are all in the exact same format ie date format etc. I can do that later on, if no-one else does first - if you have any preferences for formatting style on references or want to do it yourself please let me know.

There appears to be a backlog on articles for review so I guess there may be a delay until a reviewer turns up. It's listed in the relevant form eg Wikipedia:Good_article_nominations#Transport  """,0,0,0,0,0,1

Anyway, I'm not intending to write anything in the article(wow they would jump on me for vandalism), I'm merely requesting that it be more encyclopedic so one can use it for school as a reference. I have been to the selective breeding page but it's almost a stub. It points to 'animal breeding' which is a short messy article that gives you no info. There must be someone around with expertise in eugenics? 93.161.107.169",0,1,0,0,0,0
